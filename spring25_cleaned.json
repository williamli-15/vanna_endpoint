The road ahead was clear, as there was a well-defined path. And everyone knew what needed to be done: shrink the transistor. Now, we have reached the end of the tunnel.\"\\\nH.-S. Philip Wong, Chief Scientist, TSMC, 2024.\n\nToday’s 2D lithography has hit a fundamental wall in feature density, so the semiconductor industry has begun stacking 2D layers to fit more transistors, bits, and bandwidth on each chip. \\\n\\\nBut stacking scales cost exponentially with density, unlike the constant cost days of Moore: a 10-layer high bandwidth memory (HBM) package is \\~5x more expensive than the same amount of un-stacked DRAM.\n\n**Solution**\n\nUsing a 3D process to make today's increasingly 3D integrated circuits could shortcut this problem, scaling process complexity with materials rather than layers and enabling the next decade of continued progress.\n\nOur 3D lithography technology can do this: it is capable of fabricating multi-material 3D structures with 100 nm resolution at wafer scale.\n\nWhere the ability to create more complex forms enables more complex functions, such granular control of matter enables the future of much more than just chips, including biotech, sensing, and advanced materials.\n\nWe recently crossed the cost thresholds that make this technology commercially viable. We are currently in conversation with customers, and will be driving an exponential scaling law in the production capacity of this technology over the coming decade.\\\n\\\n**What we’ve achieved so far**\n\n* Set up our manufacturing facility and lab in Mountain View, CA.\n* Built our first 3D nano-printer.\n* Acquired our first customers, including an LOI for co-development with NVIDIA.\n\n**What’s next**\n\n* Sell our first products (this year).\n* Exponentially scale production volume.\n* SECRET.\n\n**Team**\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcMsUlRx_bo7xJvNWmZaC-39OI7Hknw0Y65Er2tjyUh54Sd4--EgCih-wQzZojhTUdUgn2OqKfPxVzmnfqnJGprg2qacYS56K-eYqnSh_n3uz75XB9uyCslMaxReWdNHhKkcVHF?key=cch75ExUod4AOIuWU2xY6A)\n\nWe’re a team of physicists and systems engineers from Caltech and NASA, where we previously matured multiple nascent technologies, winning NASA’s Most Visionary Concept and Best Product Development awards.\\\n\\\n**Advisory Board**\\\nDr. H.-S.

        "body": "Hey everyone! We're Allan and Lawrence, and we're building Willow.\n\n**TLDR**: Willow is an AI dictation app that writes anywhere on your computer. Designed for those who rely on email, messaging, and AI prompting workflows to work 4x faster.\n\n→ [Try it for free on Mac.](https://WillowVoice.com)\n\nYou can get set up in minutes and start dictating right away.\n\nLaunch video: https://youtu.be/8q9FRS8Km5U\n\n### **Why we’re building Willow Voice**\n\nWe spent an entire year pivoting across different industries before landing on Willow.\n\nWe started out building for assisted living facilities. The product didn’t land, but we discovered that dictation was a tool to help them stay connected and independent. That showed us how powerful voice could be.\n\nThen, we pivoted to building for medical clinics. We saw how AI scribes were saving doctors hours on documentation and letting them focus on patient care.\n\nThrough all these pivots, one thing became clear. Voice dictation is a superpower for anyone who types a lot. It’s 4x faster and easier than manual typing. \n\nWhy isn’t voice the default way we interact with our computers? Because the technology just wasn’t there—until now.\n\nThat insight led us to build Willow: fast, precise, and personalized voice dictation designed for how we work today.\n\n### **The solution: Willow Voice**\n\nWhat makes Willow special is that it’s not just basic voice typing. It’s smart, fast, and sounds like _you_. Here’s how:\n\n* **Context-awareness**: Willow looks at what you’re working on so it can get technical terms, names, and phrases right.\n* **Custom dictionaries**: You can add your own words—like company names, industry terms, or team slang—so they’re always spelled correctly.\n* **Smart correction and formatting**: Willow automatically fixes mistakes and adds structure—like formatting emails, breaking up paragraphs, and handling punctuation.\n* **Personalization** _(beta)_: We’re working on making Willow sound just like you—adjusting tone and style depending on what you’re writing.\n* **Privacy**: Willow runs in the cloud for speed and accuracy, but we never store or collect your voice or data. Privacy is our top priority, and it’s built into everything we do. There’s an optional, opt-in setting for users who want to help improve the model, completely anonymized.\n\nIt’s 40%+ more accurate than built-in dictation tools, works in under a second, and is so good that most users replace nearly all their typing with it.\n\n### **Who’s using Willow**\n\nPeople with heavy typing workflows love Willow because it helps them move faster and get more done. This includes: \n\n* **Engineers at YC** companies use Willow to prompt AI tools like Cursor up to 4x faster.\n* **Managers at Github, Canva, and Webflow** rely on it to brainstorm, take notes, and write docs hands-free.\n* **Sales teams** use Willow to reply instantly on Slack, email, and CRM tools.\n* **Busy professionals** drowning in email use Willow to clear out their inbox in minutes, not hours.\n\n### **Our ASK**\n\n**Try Willow Voice** → [WillowVoice.com](http://WillowVoice.com)\n\nIt helps you get work done 4x faster, just by talking rather than typing.\n\nIt’s free to start and works instantly on Mac. We’d love to hear what you think!\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90217&key=user_uploads/1946827/bc11a0ad-17c4-4f8e-b7e8-339fa9fea0bb)\n\n",

No 3rd party services like Clerk or Supabase, all integrations built in.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Vn-I7osuook\n\n**Vibe Code Web Apps**\n\nWith vibe-coding, anyone can make websites without hiring web devs.\\\nBut apps like Lovable and Bolt break when you add backend functionality. \n\nWe want anyone to be able to build fully functional apps with real backends. Imagine you want to build a recipe app! You’ll need:\n\n* File storage → store the recipe images reliably\n* Authentication → users can sign up / log in\n* Database → persist data like saved recipes\n* Email service → send updates to your users\n\n\\\nIn the coming weeks, we’re building integrations for all of these services, so you can do everything you need to, directly within Waffle. No need to sign up to any other 3rd party service like Clerk or Supabase. \n\n**Team**\n\nManuj (CEO) was previously 2nd ML hire at unicorn defence startup, Rebellion. He ranked #1 in his Maths & CS Bachelor’s at Imperial College London and graduated from Oxford with a Master’s in Advanced CS. He published a first-author AI paper at UAI 2024.\n\nDiogo (CTO) has built several mobile games. His top original game, Battle Arena, reached 1M users in 70 countries. He did his Bachelor’s in CS at EPFL and dropped out of his Master’s to build Waffle.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90409&key=user_uploads/1276829/10b9cbf1-ab0a-4aac-9db3-eeb6b243f3c2)\n\n# **Our Ask**\n\nIf you know anyone who is non-technical and has been wanting to make a website, we’d love to hear their feedback.\\\n\\\nContact us at: [founders@waffle.ai](mailto:founders@waffle.ai)",

Our platform gives AI companies the toolbox and infrastructure to build and deploy agents efficiently. \r\n\r\nBillions of agents, tools, and models will transform how we work in the coming years. Traditional cloud providers weren't designed to handle them—their one-size-fits-all architecture holds them back. We fixed that with Blaxel.\r\n\r\nWhat is it? A complete computing platform with:\r\n\r\n- all services for developers to fast-track deploying agents without reinventing the wheel — like framework-agnostic serverless deployments, an AI gateway for model routing and fallback, and custom MCP server hosting.\r\n- a flexible low-level API for builders to ship really performant agentic AI using our backbone infrastructure — using services like sandboxed VMs usable by agents, a programmable global gateway, and a 20ms-latency serverless compute engine.\r\n- and a seamless developper experience that integrates with their CI/CD, and APIs that can even be consumed by agents themselves!",

We’re [Annanay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annanay-kapila/) and [Joshua](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-wharton/), and we’re building [QFEX](http://www.qfex.com/): a global, 24/7 stock exchange.\n\n#### **What We’ve Built**\n\nTrillions of dollars change hands every day in the global financial markets, but the pace of innovation is excruciatingly slow. As of 2025, you still can’t:\n\n* Trade directly on an exchange **without a broker** (unless you’re as big as Jane Street).\n* **Trade 24/7**.\n* Get **>20x leverage** or avoid margin fees.\n* Trade leveraged US stocks without **worrying about options**.\n\nWe’re changing this.\n\nWe’ve built an exchange that provides all of the above, packaged into a sleek, **direct-to-market** interface with one-of-a-kind purely **volume-based fees**. Bye-bye Robinhood selling your orders for Citadel to front-run. Adios to the Interactive Brokers GUI. Hello to markets as they _should_ **be**.\n\nhttps://www.tella.tv/video/joshuas-video-1m32\n\nhttps://www.tella.tv/video/joshuas-video-32cb\n\n#### **Call To Action**\n\nQFEX is currently running in a closed beta with a white-glove service to match user enthusiasm. To get earlier access: \n\n* **Sign up** to our [waitlist](https://app.qfex.com/login) to get invited!\n* Follow us on socials to make sure you don’t miss out on any early access perks! [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeQFEX/) [Twitter](https://x.com/TradeQFEX) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tradeqfex) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entimox/)\n* [API](https://docs.qfex.com/) traders - welcome to the first API-native exchange! Reach out [here](mailto:hello@pfex.com) to schedule onboarding.\n* Share this post with anyone interested in trading, exchanges or crypto! \n\n#### **The Team**\n\nWe met at Cambridge studying Maths in 2016, and the rest is history. Working as Quants and Engineers at Tower Research and Citadel before YC, we spent a year trying to figure out why crypto exchanges can solve all of the above, but traditional exchanges can’t. We still haven’t found a convincing answer.\n\n#### **PS - For the Crypto/ Finance Bros**\n\nTaking a leaf out of the crypto world, [QFEX](http://www.qfex.com/) is listing Perpetual Futures in traditional assets, making it the first exchange to do so. Futures haven’t changed since the first standardized contract was made in 1865 to help farmers hedge their corn harvests. Now S&P500 futures trade $500 billion daily, but it still expires in time for the harvest. Why?\n\n[QFEX](http://www.qfex.com/) will save institutional traders billions of dollars in rolling costs, operational headache, and deeper liquidity from an unfragmented market - just like perps did for crypto. \n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90317&key=user_uploads/2318196/a0937f2e-75a9-4aeb-89fb-4152ad0abac7)\n\n",

    "long_description": "Chestnut is the first AI mortgage lender. Our AI agents help consumers save 0.5%+ in interest compared to traditional lenders.\r\n\r\nToday, 80% of employees at traditional lenders spend hours each day filling out paper forms, manually reviewing documents, and copy-pasting data between systems. These manual processes cost lenders – and ultimately their borrowers – $12,000+ per loan ($61B+ per year).\r\n\r\nAI can automate 99% of mortgage operations, but traditional lenders would take 10+ years to adapt. They’d have to overhaul their entire tech stack, rewrite every procedure, and retrain their whole workforce. Chestnut is vertically integrating AI to challenge traditional lenders directly.\r\n\r\nFounder Spencer Brown’s previous startup built a mortgage Loan Origination System that powered $85B+ in mortgage volume (1-2% of all US mortgages/yr).\r\n\r\nWe’re currently licensed in Texas and Colorado, helping clients with home purchases, refinances, cash-outs, and home equity lines of credit.",

Our AI agents help people **save 0.5%+ on their rate**.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7ay1fshd-w\n\n—\n\n# 👋 Howdy\n\nI’m Spencer, the founder of Chestnut — **the first AI mortgage lender**. My last startup built a mortgage “Loan Origination System” (system of record + workflow tool used daily by 80% of lender employees) that powered $85B+ in mortgage volume (2% of all US mortgages annually). During that time, I saw firsthand how inefficient traditional lenders are — and realized I should compete with them directly.\n\n# **🤨** Isn’t the mortgage process already automated?\n\nFar from it. Today, 80% of employees at traditional lenders **spend** **hours each day** filling out paper forms, manually reviewing documents, and copy-pasting data between systems. These manual processes cost lenders – and ultimately their borrowers – $12,000+ per loan ($61B+ per year).\n\n# **😲** What’s next?\n\nAI can automate 99% of mortgage operations, but **traditional lenders would take 10+ years** to adapt. They’d have to overhaul their entire tech stack, rewrite every procedure, and retrain their whole workforce.\n\n# ➡️ Enter Chestnut\n\nChestnut is **vertically integrating AI** to challenge traditional lenders directly. Besides Ashley, our AI loan officer assistant, we’ve also built agents that:\n\n1. **Find the best deals** by shopping rates across 100+ lenders (since we’re starting with brokering),\n2. **Cut borrowing costs** by automating the origination process, and\n3. **Notify clients** when rates drop.\n\nSo far, we’re licensed in Texas and Colorado where we’re helping clients with new home purchases, refinances, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit.\n\n# 🤑 Ready to save?\n\nIf you’re exploring mortgage options in Texas or Colorado, **head over to [our website](https://chestnutmortgage.com?utm_source=launch-yc&utm_medium=cta-link&utm_campaign=launch-yc)** where you can get an instant quote and compare our rates to other lenders!\n\n—\n\nCheers!\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90630&key=user_uploads/285403/adefaf94-0d5d-4bad-aafc-788d26e493ee)\n\n",

We’ve partnered with radiology chains for large-scale imaging data, and have a global marketplace of radiologists for rapid, high-quality annotations.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2MYjUFp3r0Q?feature=shared\n\n## ❗The Problem\n\nAI is transforming healthcare, but the biggest bottleneck is still **access to medical images from hospitals and annotations by expert doctors**.\n\nHealthcare AI and life sciences companies spend millions collecting medical images and hiring expert radiologists. But annotations? They're still:\n\n📝 Manual\\\n🐢 Slow\\\n🔍 Hard to QA\n\nFinding expert annotators with deep domain knowledge is tough, which means R&D teams waste months and large budgets on a process that should be seamless.\n\nMedical annotation itself is uniquely challenging because it involves:\n\n📦 Gigabyte-scale files\\\n🧠 Complex, multi-dimensional data that’s sensitive to loss\\\n🎯 Accuracy that’s absolutely critical\n\nYet most teams still use open-source desktop tools like 3D Slicer, built decades ago for solo researchers. These tools:\n\n🚫 Require local machines\\\n📉 Offer no real-time collaboration\\\n📊 Force spreadsheet-based coordination\\\n🔐 Risk compliance and data security\n\nAnd the result?\\\nHighly trained radiologists are stuck doing repetitive tasks manually wasting time, slowing innovation, and compromising data quality.\n\n## 🧠 Our Solution\n\nWe transform the way healthcare AI teams prepare data by **accelerating and streamlining the entire annotation pipeline** — cutting timelines from months down to days.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n✅ Deliver fully annotated **medical datasets** tailored for AI research needs\n\n✅ Provide certified and benchmarked **radiologists** for annotation and quality assurance\n\n✅ Offer advanced, browser-based annotation tools for all kinds of medical images—radiology, pathology, histopathology, including X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc\n\n✅ Use **AI assistance** to make annotators **10x faster**\n\n✅ Enable customizable clinical workflows with multi-stage reviews & annotations\n\n✅ Ensure **FDA-Ready** annotation versioning, consensus checks, and full audit trails\n\n✅ Track annotator performance in cost, time, and **accuracy** - all built in\n\n### 🤝 The Team\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXctdUlgsBRg891fZ4XU-Ve5trM2bw_h1PYuoQCy0NxrUigEoWMrHYVBO3D3IoAaUC7UPvtDzGxg0C_x2gyO0ujmyJs3_FxtXpLzIVPiUfIZqDKotuf5oeOiGmHyyPRLAzeDm9ORsA?key=Rm0k0m7MflJlURnfdp3zng)\n\nNikhil (left) and Shivesh (right) have been friends since their days at **IIT Bombay**, studying and building together. While working on healthcare AI projects, they experienced firsthand how painful annotation can be especially for large, multi-dimensional medical images that demand extreme accuracy.\n\n[**Nikhil**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhiltiwari-iitb/) (CEO) - Former software engineer at **Stripe, Amazon**, and Marsh McLennan, where he worked on infrastructure, performance optimization, and low-level systems. He graduated from **IIT Bombay** last year, where he led technical initiatives in the student body SARC and built platforms used by 10,000+ students.\n\n[**Shivesh**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivesh-gupta-iitb/) (CTO) - Former systems software engineer at **Sony Japan**. He holds an engineering degree from **IIT Bombay**. During his time there, he worked on healthcare AI research and also led the institute’s web and coding club.\n\n## 👋 Our Ask\n\nKnow someone building AI in healthcare whether it’s diagnostic models, clinical trial workflows, or robotic surgery? We’d love to connect.\n\nWe have special offers for academic research, connect us with professors at your university working in healthcare AI!\n\nGot questions or want to chat?

We’re building Plexe, an open-source agent that turns natural language task descriptions into trained ML models.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CwNX0aU9MsE\n\n## **🤔 1. Problem**\n\nLots of great use cases for ML models in businesses never materialize because ML projects are messy and convoluted. You spend months finding the data, cleaning it, experimenting with models and deploying them to production, only to find out that the project has been binned due to taking so long. At a previous employer, we witnessed a team of 10 ML engineers spend 2 years and $3M building models for a project that never saw the light of day. \n\nThere are several tools for “automating” ML, but it still takes teams of ML experts to actually productionize something of value. And we can’t keep throwing LLMs at every ML problem. Why use a generic 10B parameter language model, if a logistic regression trained on your data could do the job better?\n\n## **✅ 2. Solution**\n\nStep 1: Connect your data sources\\\nStep 2: Describe your problem statement\\\nStep 3: Use the deployed model via API\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zByvH0wTSuE\n\n## **🚀 3. How does it work?**\n\nPlexe uses a self-correcting team of ML engineering agents to research, experiment, evaluate, refine, and deploy the best performing model over an API endpoint. It connects to data sources, discovering relevant fields, and autonomously building the model. Think of it like your own ML helper helping you go from idea to deployed models 10x faster.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bUwCSglhcXY\n\n## **👋 4. Team**\n\n[Vaibhav Dubey](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/user/2260416) (ex-Proofpoint, Expedia, Imperial College London) and [Marcello De Bernardi](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/user/2337737) (ex-AWS, Expedia, Oxford) met 6 years ago while building a chatbot that served 9+ million customers of a large bank. Since then, they’ve built enterprise-scale ML solutions that serve billions of predictions per day for millions of users worldwide.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90589&key=user_uploads/2260416/4e5a0513-e013-4adc-9520-ebde07c44981)\n\n## **🙏 5. Our ask**\n\n* We’d love to get in touch with any companies that have a lot of data but have not been able to build ML features on top of them!\n* If you’re an individual who believes that the future of ML development is autonomous and open source, check out our agent: https://github.com/plexe-ai/plexe\n\nGet in touch with us: [founders@plexe.ai](mailto:founders@plexe.ai) ",

We come with pre-built building blocks: Integrations (Gmail, Gcal, Github, Jira, etc.), SSO and AI tools (Websearch, Summarization etc.) so anyone in a company can build and launch internal AI-powered apps.\r\n\r\nVibe coding is dramatically lowering the barrier for non-technical users to create full web apps. Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Google, Canva, Figma all launched their vibe-coding platforms. People love them. They're great for prototyping, but it's difficult to roll out inside a company for internal use cases for those reasons: \r\n\r\n1. Data: If you want to connect your existing data (e.g. Salesforce, Gmail, Jira), you'd need to rebuild the API auth, pagination, etc. \r\n\r\n2. SSO: If you build 20 apps, you'll have 20 different logins\r\n\r\n3. Security: AI-built apps have massive risk of exposing data, especially if built by non developers\r\n\r\nSo companies are stuck in the old world: clunky spreadsheets, rigid SaaS solutions or complex no-code tools.\r\n\r\nTime to build!

        "body": "Fabien (Wolfia, S22) and myself (Plato, W16), are back to building again and today, we’re excited to share what we've been cooking for the past few months! And we’re part of the current batch!\n\nWe’re building a Lovable for internal apps. We come with pre-built building blocks: Integrations, SSO, and AI tools so anyone in a company can build and launch internal apps.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jaB3EnuU_cI\n\nI included 5-6 other examples of things I built to run Vybe on vybe below :)\n\n# The unsolved problem:\n\nFast‑growing teams drown in \\_glue work\\_—onboarding trackers, launch calendars, status bots, one‑off scripts. Each steals engineering time, rots when its owner leaves, and derails sprints.\n\nIt leaves companies with three bad options:\n\n* Rigid enterprise SaaS – inflexible, forces your process to fit the tool.\n* Spreadsheets & docs – endless copy‑paste, no live data, fragile at scale.\n* DIY glue & drag‑and‑drop no‑code – a tangle of scripts and widgets that collapse when owners leave.\n\n# **Why current vibe coding tools aren’t enough:**\n\nVibe coding is dramatically lowering the barrier for non-technical users to create full web apps. Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Google, Canva, Figma all launched their vibe-coding platforms. People love them. They're great for prototyping, but it's difficult to roll out inside a company for internal use cases for those reasons:\n\n* Data: If you want to connect your existing data (e.g. Salesforce, Gmail, Jira), you'd need to rebuild the API auth, pagination, etc.\n* SSO: If you build 20 apps, you'll have 20 different logins…\n* Security: AI-built apps have the massive risk of exposing data, especially if built by non-developers\n\nCursor and Windsurf are not adapted either. They’re built for devs, hard to use for non-technical folks. My Head of HR doesn’t know how to deploy an app in Netlify or Vercel.\n\n# **Why old no-code tools are solutions of the past:**\n\n* Airtable / Retool / Coda: No‑code and low‑code platforms showed you can build dashboards faster than hand‑coding React—but you're still dragging rectangles, hunting for SQL, and rebuilding the same CRUD table for the hundredth time.\n* Large‑language models have changed the game. Code‑gen IDEs already write production‑grade functions from chat—so why are we still moving boxes to connect Salesforce to a launch‑approval form?\n\n**We’d love your help:**\n\n1. Companies: Design partners: Pick a painful process internally in your company, let us rebuild it in a more robust way.\n2.

Comment \"waitlist\" or re-post, and we'll bump you to the top of the list!\n\nHere are some nice examples of things I built on Vybe:\n\n**A daily briefer of my day,** an AI is doing a web search on every single person I’m meeting every day:\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90606&key=user_uploads/3335/f071030a-e15f-4df2-9ae3-6f09d2add985)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90606&key=user_uploads/3335/2789a7da-2558-434e-abc2-8836d9a4f205)\n\n**A weekly goals tracker** with a count down until YC demo day:\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90606&key=user_uploads/3335/9296e031-ab0a-4b39-82cd-9905c961f08d)\n\n**Our backlog/roadmap** of things to ship:\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90606&key=user_uploads/3335/7a626545-91b5-4258-8dd9-6db0dc33c2ae)\n\n**Our DB Admin** fed by our production database (postgres) built in 10 mins:\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90606&key=user_uploads/3335/aa9494e4-89f9-4ebd-b005-2b9a8b8b2c3f)\n\n**A simple to-do** i created with routines, timer and link to my tech backlog so i can easily add tasks to myself from the roadmap\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90606&key=user_uploads/3335/75b7bfc7-baa9-4198-8613-a46b2f7434dd)\n\n\\*\\*A nice CRM (\\*\\*no, i don’t use Salesforce, Hubspot or any other CRM) that is connected to my postgres so i can monitor deals and usages at the same place\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90606&key=user_uploads/3335/36acd4ee-8bb7-495d-b1a0-802346cf57e6)\n\nAnd check tens of other examples: https://www.vybe.build/examples\n\nIt’s time to build 💪 Join the waitlist: https://www.vybe.build/ and we’ll accept you as fast as we can!

We’re building nao so they can **data vibe** too.\n\n**🏎 TL;DR**\n\nnao is an **AI code editor to write code on data**: a local editor, connected to your data warehouse, with an AI copilot that has context of both your data schema and codebase.\\\nIt’s built specifically for data workflows - helping teams write faster, better code, while being ensured of the data quality.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90397&key=user_uploads/1535815/f9051a44-1d1e-41a0-b995-e6bcb94a4c31)\n\n**🧑‍💻 Who is it for?**\n\n* **Data teams** who run analytics with SQL and build dbt or Python pipelines\n* **Software developers** who manage SQL databases\n\n**🤖 What can you do with nao?**\n\nYou can prompt nao **AI agent** to:\n\n* **Create SQL queries & dbt models** from your data warehouse tables\n* Add **documentation & testing** to your data\n* **Refactor** your codebase through your **lineage**\n* Perform **data quality checks**, **data diff** tests\n* Run **conversational analytics**\n\n**nao AI tab auto-suggests code for your data** — only with tables, columns and data that actually exist in your warehouse.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90397&key=user_uploads/1535815/08d1f6f0-b247-4887-b179-c0f5f2cd8405)\n\n**🔆 Why we built it**\n\nChristophe and Claire have each spent 10 years in data. We’ve seen that data teams can’t keep the business pace because making changes in data requires too many tools and tests.\\\nCurrent AI code editors don’t interact natively with data warehouses — they autocomplete SQL blindly, not knowing your data schema. We built nao so that data teams can ship at business pace, with an AI code editor that has all their context.\n\n**👀 Watch it live**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmG6X-5ftZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmG6X-5ftZU&ab_channel=ClaireGouze)\n\n**👋🏻 Our ask**\n\nWant to write code on your data faster?\n\n* **Download** and test nao here: [**https://getnao.io/**](https://getnao.io/**)\n* **Contact us** for team plans: [claire@getnao.io](mailto:claire@getnao.io)",

        "body": "Hi YC,\n\nWe’re Wojciech and Antoni -  high school friends who’ve been building together since we were 14. We're incredibly bullish on a future where AI agents have their own internet through which they access our services - so much so that we dropped out of university to build Golf.\n\n**Golf lets you ship a production-ready MCP server without worrying about the plumbing.** You just write the tools, prompts, and resources you want agents to call. Golf handles everything else - routing, auth, telemetry, error reporting, and deployment. Then you can observe and manage it through our gateway.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/u9ar4w2uE7E\n\n# **The problem**\n\nOver the past few weeks, we spoke with over 40 teams building MCP servers. Everyone hit the same walls: wiring up authentication, figuring out how to trace agent calls, setting up working transports, and debugging behavior in production. The MCP spec doesn’t cover these parts. Teams told us it takes **2-4 weeks** to get that to production.\n\n# **What we built**\n\n**GolfMCP** is an open-source framework that gives you a clear, file-based structure to define what your agent can call. No decorators, no spec knowledge, no boilerplate - just write your logic.\n\n**Golf Gateway** is the hosted layer that runs and observes your server. golf deploy gives you a live server in under 60 seconds, with real-time traces, tool usage, and error monitoring built in.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90569&key=user_uploads/1366358/b035bdc4-02c2-42d5-a230-ad38be34dfa9)\n\n# **Early traction**\n\nWe’re already running Golf in production with companies, and we’ve got more landing this week. \n\n**CTAs**\\\nIf you are looking to ship server for your company, schedule a demo of our platform here: https://golf.dev\\\nAlso we’d love to get your feedback, and we’re happy to help teams get to production faster.

        "body": "# **How do you win a war?**\n\nIt’s a question most people don’t want to ever have to answer.\n\n**But for the first time since WW2, democracy is under direct attack.**\n\nDefense companies can make billions selling theoretical solutions, but once sh\\*\\* hits the fan and missiles are landing ten kilometers from your apartment, you’re going to want what works. Quickly.\n\nSo we dropped out of Caltech and went to Ukraine to figure out what really worked. Amidst Russian shaheds striking in the distance and Kyiv’s air defenses lighting up the sky, we met with soldiers, hackers, and engineers. Their striking kindness and hospitality in the face of total mobilization and a ceaseless stream of air raid sirens was indescribable. The invasion wasn’t just war, but _industrialized hatred._\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90281&key=user_uploads/2575745/03cd93d8-01b6-477c-bb34-825ba2c5f171)\n\n\\\nIt turns out war is hacking. Drones and robots – code – now dictate the battlefield. Gear from big name U.S. defense tech becomes obsolete in a month. The pipeline from R&D to testing to the battlefield is too slow for a real war.\\\n\\\nSo we’re making a new defense company, one which leads from the front. Literally. Our first product, PALLAS, will resolve ad-hoc drone software standards and replace the FPV operator with a drone commander–allowing them to pilot thousands of devices at once instead of just one. Handcrafted from combat user feedback, it will be optimized for victory – not ticking boxes in a contract.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90281&key=user_uploads/2575745/518325b4-9458-4d5b-9cd6-b17ca1a69464)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90281&key=user_uploads/2575745/ffee1ea6-7489-4e27-9753-db14843f832c)\n\n\\-Emmanuel Margolin, Arhum Jain.\\\nPlease contact us for detailed specifics on our software, what we learnt about modern war in Ukraine, and the engineering that will allow a single ground-station to control many different types of devices, including in EW affected areas. \\\n[founders@notussystems.com](mailto:founders@notussystems.com).\\\n[www.notussystems.com](http://www.notussystems.com)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90281&key=user_uploads/2575745/8a589db1-72ee-42f9-85bb-7fe961b95584)\n\n",

It learns from your codebase's patterns, points out bugs, suggesting fixes, and frees you from low-level review tasks.\r\n- You then jump into the cubic platform, which is designed to optimize how humans review code. For example, file changes are organized in a logical order instead of alphabetical, and cubic generates diagrams of architecture changes.",

        "body": "**🎯 TL;DR**\n\ncubic is an AI-powered code review platform that automatically reviews PRs and gives human reviewers superpowers.\n\nIt helps teams like [**cal.com**](http://cal.com), **n8n**, and the **Linux Foundation** ship code 28% faster.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7bzIJYy0Nfw\n\nHey! 👋 We’re Allis and Paul – founders of cubic.\n\nWe’re building cubic – an AI code review platform to help teams ship code faster with fewer bugs.\n\n[🚀 See it in action for cal.com here](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/20771)\n\n🎁 **Launch deal**\n\nIf you’re a developer, and you feel like code reviews are slowing you down + bugs slip through, give cubic a try.\n\nIt’s free for 2 weeks, and you’ll get an extra 30% off for 2 months with the code: _YCLAUNCH_\n\n[**Just sign up with your Github account to get started!**](http://cubic.dev/home)\n\n**⭐️ Why did we start cubic?**\n\nWe’re engineers who faced this problem when we worked together in the past. As we adopted more AI code gen tools, code review and ensuring quality quickly became our biggest bottleneck.\n\nWe had more PRs to review, subtle AI-written bugs slipped in, and we (humans) found ourselves rubber-stamping PRs without deeply understanding the changes.\n\n**👷 We’re building cubic to help solve that. Here’s how it works:**\n\n1. Connect your GitHub repo via our Github app in two clicks\n2. AI review: When you open a PR, our AI reviews your changes directly in a secure container. It has context into not just that PR, but your whole codebase, so it can pick up patterns and leave comments directly on changed lines. Once the review is done, the sandbox is torn down and your code deleted.\n3. Human-friendly review workflow: Jump into our web (or desktop) app (it’s like Linear but for PRs). Changes are grouped logically (not alphabetically), with important diffs highlighted, visualized, and ready for faster human review.\n\n💻 The AI reviewer works a bit like Cursor in the sense that it navigates your codebase using the same tools a developer would—like jumping to definitions or grepping through code.\n\n⚡️ The platform itself focuses entirely on making _human_ code reviews easier. A big inspiration came from productivity-focused apps like Linear or Superhuman, products that show just how much thoughtful design can impact everyday workflows. We wanted to bring that same feeling to code review.\n\nThat’s one reason we built a desktop app. It allowed us to deliver a more polished experience, complete with keyboard shortcuts and a snappy interface.\n\nWe think the future of coding isn’t about AI replacing humans—it’s about giving us better tools to quickly understand high-level changes, abstracting more and more of the code itself. As code volume continues to increase, this shift is going to become increasingly important.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90581&key=user_uploads/1453819/af22052f-6cbe-4cc6-863f-9dd72f10add5)\n\n",

        "body": "Hi! We’re [**Mehul Shah**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehulmshah22), [**Nick Warren**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickcw/), [**Matthew Noseworthy**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-noseworthy-218167106/) — co-founders of [**GroundControl**](https://rungroundcontrol.com/).\n\n[**https://youtu.be/s2heFLI1R80**](https://youtu.be/s2heFLI1R80)\n\n**TL;DR** — We've onboarded 70+ manufacturing facilities as customers throughout the US. Our core product automates lengthy, complex, and regulated quality documentation in aerospace manufacturing.\n\n**How We Started**\n\nNick and Matt co-founded their last startup (InspectAR) with Mehul's brother before being acquired by Cadence ($CDNS). I (Mehul) spent the last decade in my family business, where we built PCBs for every advanced system on Earth: rockets, satellites, aircraft, fighter jets, and more. We noticed despite building for innovation, manufacturing operations were antiquated and bogged down with manual processes.\n\nFirst Article Inspection Reports (AS9102s) were creating a bottleneck in quality. Parts would be built and ready to ship, just waiting on paperwork. Our facilities were doing 15 reports a day, 8 hours per report. The worst part? Even if the part was built exactly to spec — if a single typo was found by the customer, the report would get rejected and payment delayed until the report was fixed.\n\n**What We Built**\n\nOur core product automates first article inspection reporting for regulated manufacturing. Quality teams can balloon drawings and automate inspection report generation in minutes, instead of days.\n\n**Our Vision**\n\nToday, over 70 facilities across the US generate almost 1000 reports a month on our platform. This is just the beginning. We'll continue to build for quality, and upstream towards operations, engineering, and sales to empower manufacturers with AI. GroundControl will embed itself across the global supply chain, from Tier 4 suppliers to OEMs with vertically integrated manufacturing.\n\n**Our Ask**\n\nIf you know anyone in regulated manufacturing (aerospace, automotive, medical), or their customers (OEMs like Lockheed, SpaceX, Anduril, etc.) we would love to chat. Reach us at [**founders@gndctl.com**](mailto:founders@gndctl.com) or **408-390-4460**.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90406&key=user_uploads/1816593/5a76bc6a-30b2-49fb-9e27-43c222bcab9d)\n\n",

We’re [Smit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitdagli/) and [Vik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikhyath-m-a00357128/) - the founders of [Kanava AI](https://kanava.ai/)\n\n**Problem and Opportunity:**\n\nThe wholesale distribution industry is massive: _$9T+ in annual revenue. 410,000+ businesses. 6 million+ employees._\n\nAnd yet — sales teams are drowning.\n\n* **A third of the workforce is over 55**, and replacements aren’t coming fast enough.\n\n  (“Most of my sales reps are **retiring in the next 2-3 years**, I have **NO idea** what I’ll do after” - a medium sized electrical goods distributor from Indiana we met)\n* **Reps spend less than 30% of their time selling**. The rest? Answering repetitive calls (“What’s the price of this SKU?” “Which warehouse has it?”), digging through systems, and manual follow-ups.\n* **Over 25% of inbound calls never reach a human** — lost revenue, lost trust, lost time.\n\nThis isn’t just inefficiency. It’s operational drag at scale — and it's only getting worse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1NVVxRnLL8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1NVVxRnLL8%5C%5C)\n\n**How’re we solving it:**\n\nWe’re building Kanava AI, a voice-based AI agent designed for wholesale distributors.\n\nIt handles repetitive tasks like **answering stock, price,** and **order status calls** using live **ERP** data and logging **field notes hands-free**, drafting follow-ups, updating the **CRM** all _automatically_.\n\nIt’s like a junior rep-in-training. It starts with the basics, but improves quickly by learning from the company’s best performers. Over time, Kanava takes on more:\n\n•⁠ **⁠Managing consultative sales calls** \\\n•⁠ ⁠**Identifying upsell opportunities** in real time \\\n•⁠ ⁠**Surfacing coaching insights** from rep conversations \\\n•⁠ ⁠**Re-engaging dormant accounts** with timely, data-backed outreach\n\nAnd by the time these reps are ready to retire, Kanava is **ready to fill the void they leave.**\n\nMost AI tools in this space fail because they try to do too much, too early, and distributors are famously late adopters. We’re taking a more deliberate path: start with low-leverage work, prove value, and scale responsibility as the system earns it.\n\n**Our Team**\n\nVik (CTO) and Smit (CEO) know each other since freshman year of college at UC Berkeley. Both of us studied CS, and worked as AI engineers at various startups before deciding to build our own thing and join YC.\n\n**Smit:** Built incident resolution agents at a series B observability startup called Observe. Previously worked at Abnormal Security and Salesforce.\n\n**Vik**: Built voice agents for numerical data entry and hands-free navigation for a data management platform called Uncountable. Previously worked at Uber and Amazon.\n\nWe’re both outsiders to the wholesale distribution industry, but we’re listening hard and learning fast.\n\nWhat made us really want to work together was being on the same ultimate frisbee team in the senior year of college - that team was a disaster, we lost every single game we played by huge margins, but despite that, we had a ton of fun and stuck together!\n\n**Our Ask** If you know any **distributors, field sales heavy businesses or IMR’s (Independent Manufacturer Reps)**, we’d appreciate a connection at [smit@kanava.ai](mailto:smit@kanava.ai) or [vikhyath@kanava.ai](mailto:vikhyath@kanava.ai). We’ll make their lives a lot easier and buy you a coffee ☕🤎\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90571&key=user_uploads/2493431/bdc2c377-20b6-4db8-ac56-448fb5adafa6)\n\n",

And practically speaking, do you really want to **give up control** of your entire machine just so the agent can do its job?\n\n**In short: How can AI agents interact with operating systems, desktop applications, and browsers without jeopardizing security or sacrificing performance?**\n\n### **⭐ Solution: An end-to-end framework**\n\nWe combined **Apple's Virtualization.Framework** with an agent-friendly interface to create:\n\n\\- **Lightweight VMs**: Run at 97% of native CPU speed on Apple Silicon, giving you near-native performance in a secure, virtualized space.\n\n\\- **Sandboxed Execution**: AI agents operate in tightly controlled environments, allowing secure interaction with desktop applications - without risking your host system.\n\n\\- **LLM-Compatible Runtimes**: Works out-of-the-box with popular LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source tools like Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenRouter.\n\nAnd we now support **MCP**! You can use Claude Desktop or Cursor, as your personal assistant to navigate even notoriously challenging apps like Tableau. Watch the demo to see it in action!\n\n[**https://youtu.be/NTUVU1aBs3c**](https://youtu.be/NTUVU1aBs3c)\n\n### **⚙️ How It Works**\n\n**c/ua** brings together three powerful components into one unified framework stack:\n\n1\\. **Lume** - Our high-performance Virtualization layer leverages Apple's Virtualization.Framework to spin up macOS or Linux environments.\n\n2\\. **Computer-Use Interface (CUI)** - This layer lets any process or AI agent - no matter which framework it's built on (like AutoGen, LangGraph, etc.) - see the screen and interact with Lume VMs just like a human would. It supports actions such as clicking, typing, scrolling, and extracting the visual accessibility tree.\n\n3\\. **Computer-Use Agent (CUA)** - Built on top of CUI, this general agent framework runs intelligent workflows within these VMs. It's compatible with popular LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, as well as open-source tools like Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenRouter.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=89628&key=user_uploads/1644303/c3e0e845-3223-4b82-85d1-316e41d9875c)\n\nAn AI agent built with **c/ua** operates within a virtual environment to:\n\n\\- Navigate and interact with any application's interface\n\n\\- Read screen content and perform keyboard/mouse actions\n\n\\- Switch between applications and self-debug when needed\n\n\\- Operate in a secure sandbox with controlled file access\n\nAll of this occurs in a fully isolated environment, ensuring your host system, files, and sensitive data remain completely secure - while you continue using your device without interruption.\n\n### **🖥️ What Can You Build with c/ua?**\n\n**c/ua** lets AI agents use real desktop apps - just like a human. For example:\n\n\\- **CAD Copilot**: Modify 3D models in tools like Fusion 360 or FreeCAD.\n\n\\- **Photoshop Assistant**: Crop, layer, and export assets via prompt.\n\n\\- **Operator for Tableau**: Navigate dashboards and filters with natural language.\n\n\\- **Legacy App Automator**: Control apps and websites with no APIs through UI actions.\n\n### **🤝 Our Asks:**\n\nIf you're done burning money on fragile browser automations or slow, over-engineered computer-use agents - it's time to try c/ua:\n\n* Book a call: <https://cal.com/francesco-bonacci/cua-demo>\n* Email us: [founders@trycua.com](mailto:founders@trycua.com)\n\nAlso don’t forget to:\n\n1\\.

No sales reps? No problem, we scale your team instantly.\n\n**🧠 What SynthioLabs does:**\n\n✅ Identifies and screens physicians\n\n✅ Engages in compliant, medical discussions\n\n✅ Educates on clinical guidelines and evidence\n\n✅ Books follow-ups with your medical and sales teams\n\n**📡 The Synthio Polaris Platform for Physician Engagement**\n\nWe’re building more than just one agent.

We enable patients to securely connect their medical records from over 800 healthcare institutions across more than 12,000 locations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. We also connect with over 20 popular wearable devices including Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Dexcom, bringing all your medical records and health data into one unified space. \r\n\r\nWe founded Galen because for over four years, Viraj struggled to navigate several conditions related to chronic low back pain. He often found himself waiting weeks for responses from his care team, received little guidance or education about new diagnoses, and was overwhelmed trying to manage overlapping conditions and medications.\r\n\r\nHis experiences are not unique. Our healthcare system is overloaded and fragmented, and often, patients are left to navigate their care on their own. Everyday there are nearly 1 billion health-related Google searches, but the responses to such queries are generic and impersonalized, because the searches lack any insight into a users personal health background.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging your own data and state-of-the art LLM memory capabilities, Galen delivers personalized insights, proactive health recommendations, and 24/7 on-demand medical support — empowering patients to be an active part of their health team. We are a consumer app in beta testing and will be available on the App Store soon!",

        "body": "👋 Hey, I’m [Viraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/virajmehta28/), and along with my cofounder [Priyanka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanka-shrestha-/) I’m excited to introduce Galen AI!\n\n**TL;DR:** Galen is your on-demand AI healthcare assistant, securely connecting all your health data to provide highly personalized support.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sTh-Af8mAx4\n\n**Our Main Ask:** if you want to stay on top of your health, join our [waitlist](https://getwaitlist.com/waitlist/28135) and keep an eye out for our upcoming App Store launch!\n\nCan’t wait get started? Email us at [founders@galenai.com](mailto:founders@galenai.com) to join our private beta and start getting health insights today!\n\n**💥 The Problem**\n\nFor 4+ years now, I’ve struggled to navigate several chronic low back conditions. I often waited weeks for responses from my care team, received little guidance about new diagnoses, and felt overwhelmed trying to manage overlapping conditions and medications.\n\nI found myself turning to ChatGPT. A lot. And quickly, Priyanka and I realized my experience is not unique…it’s the norm. Our healthcare system is overloaded and fragmented, doctors are pressed for time, and patients are expected navigate the majority of it alone.\n\nIncreasingly, **patients are trusting LLMs with their health questions**, but these tools weren’t built to understand a person’s full clinical history, wearable data, and evolving health context, so they fall short of delivering truly personalized insights.\n\n**🧠 Our Solution**\n\nMeet Galen AI — our AI-powered solution to make high-quality, personal medical support accessible to everyone. No more screenshotting your records and uploading them to ChatGPT. No more WebMD rabbit holes about your symptoms. No more waiting months for your next doctor’s appointment.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90700&key=user_uploads/1833511/b89751e0-80e4-479d-aa23-bf7209579b13)\n\n**All Your Medical Data in One Place**\n\nGalen securely integrates with **Apple HealthKit** to connect directly to your medical records, allowing you to unify health data from all your providers and institutions in one place.\n\nIt also syncs with your **Apple Watch** to bring in daily fitness and activity data, with support for **20+ additional wearables** coming soon.\n\nAs you share new symptoms and health updates, Galen **keeps track** and **continuously learns** about your evolving needs, providing long-term support.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90700&key=user_uploads/1833511/cc5d7b50-ea97-4b63-926e-92bb25049ead)\n\n**Talk to Your Health Data**\n\nOnce your records are connected, you can:\n\n* Receive clear, **comprehensive summaries** of your medical history\n* Ask questions about and **uncover patterns** in your health data\n* **Understand new symptoms** in the context of your existing conditions\n* **Receive tailored insights** about medication side effects or interactions, comorbidities, and treatment impacts\n\n🌲 **Meet the Team!**\n\nWe met working on a class project at Stanford and haven’t stopped building together since.\n\nPriyanka, originally pre-med, conducted clinical and biocomputation research at Stanford SAIL, Cleveland Clinic, and UCLA, and worked as a software engineer at Roche. I worked as an engineer at Optiver and quantitative trader at IMC Trading before developing a strong interest in healthcare through my personal experiences.\n\nWe both pursued a BS/MS in Computer Science from Stanford and have collaborated on several AI and healthcare projects, including a mobile app for cancer patients with the Stanford Center of Biodesign.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90700&key=user_uploads/1833511/5c75bcc2-45d3-4189-a648-772afed8244d)\n\nWe’d love to hear from you; please reach out if you want to chat → [founders@galenai.com](mailto:founders@galenai.com).

        "body": "Hey YC! 👋\n\nWe're Xinan, Will, Matt, and Sky—co-founders of Auctor. We’re building an AI-native platform that streamlines enterprise software implementations.\n\n**TL;DR:**\\\nEnterprise software implementations (Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, etc.) are messy and expensive, plagued by shifting requirements, misaligned teams, and obsolete documentation. Auctor's AI agents solve this by automatically capturing requirements, generating artifacts (like SoWs, proposals, architecture docs, user stories, and more), and seamlessly syncing everything across your tools, eliminating costly delays and change orders.\n\n🎬 **Launch Video:** https://youtu.be/A-T2gwZCOMM\n\n## **🚨 The Problem**\n\nEvery implementation team—whether at software vendors or tech consultancies—knows this pain:\n\n* Fuzzy, incomplete requirements at kickoff\n* Tribal knowledge buried in notes and scattered docs\n* Endless manual edits across SOWs, user stories, test plans, and more\n* Costly rework, misalignment, and change orders\n\nDespite billions invested annually, over 70% of enterprise implementations still experience significant delays, overruns, and failures.\n\n## **🚀 Our Solution**\n\nAfter over 300 customer calls, we've spent the last several months building what we think every implementation team needs:\\\n🧠 AI agents that join your discovery/refinement calls,\n\n✍️ capture every requirement,\n\n📄 generate artifacts—from SOWs & design docs to user stories & configs,\n\n🔁 and keep it all in sync every time something changes.\n\n**It’s like having a sales engineer, solutions architect, and a delivery lead...all working 24/7, automatically.**\n\n# 👫  **The Team**\n\nWe are four best friends who gave up our jobs at Meta, Google, AWS, and Apple, and dropped out of Johns Hopkins to tackle the broken implementation process head-on. \n\nWe're building a new intelligence layer that leading mid-market and enterprise customers are leveraging today to reshape how implementations get done, faster than ever.\n\nOh—and meet our fifth cofounder (Chief Bark Officer 🐶) in the photo!\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90211&key=user_uploads/1780083/82da5007-0632-4ce8-9bad-43b68de9ee9b)\n\n## **🙏 Our Ask**\n\n* Know any professional services, customer success, or tech consulting leaders struggling with complex implementations? We'd love an intro 👉 [will@getauctor.com](mailto:xinan@getauctor.com)\n* Curious how Auctor can transform your own implementations?[ Book a live demo here!](https://www.getauctor.com)\n\nThank you—more to come!",

        "body": "Hey everyone, we’re [Arjun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-lalwani/) & [Helly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hellyshah/), co-founders of Approval AI. 👋\n\n**TL;DR**\\\n[Approval AI](https://www.getapproval.ai/) **is America’s first AI mortgage platform built to help homebuyers save time, money, and stress.** We automate the most painful parts of getting a mortgage: paperwork, rate shopping, and negotiation, all in one place.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bcmC6xe9nUA\n\n# **🏦 The Mortgage Problem**\n\nMore than half of homebuyers don’t shop for a mortgage, even though it could save them a significant amount of money. Why? Because the process is so overwhelming:\\\n🧱 **High friction** \\\nSwitching lenders is a hassle. Buyers have to upload the same documents to multiple portals, navigate different requirements, and jump on calls with each loan officer.\n\n**💸 Lack of know-how** \\\nMost buyers don’t know they _can_ shop around or how to do it. Confusing terms like “points” and “relationship pricing” make it hard to know what’s actually a good deal. So buyers stick with the first lender out of convenience, not confidence. And switching later feels risky as it could delay or even derail the deal.\n\n**☎️ Spam overload** \\\nShopping for a mortgage often triggers a flood of unwanted calls and emails from lenders.\n\n# **✨ The Approval AI Magic**\n\nApproval AI reimagines how homebuyers get a mortgage. With one simple form, our AI assistant handles the entire process, so buyers get the best loan with less work.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PCUBgSjUvNw?si=qXIssoIa_zCaaWH3\n\n**📄 One form. Every lender.** \\\nLike a “Common App” for mortgages, buyers complete one form and our AI handles the rest. It finds the best lenders for a buyer’s profile, shares the necessary details, and guides them seamlessly from pre-approval to closing.\n\n📞 **AI-powered negotiation** \\\nOur AI assistant reaches out to banks, brokers, and credit unions to request quotes, negotiate rates, and compare offers, getting buyers the best deal with zero awkward calls.\n\n🤖 \\*\\*Smart Guidance, Human Support.\\*\\*\\\nThe AI assistant is available 24/7 to answer questions and explain mortgage terms in plain language. When more help is needed, human experts are just a message away.\n\n**🚫 Zero spam**\\\nWe protect buyers’ personal data and only share what’s necessary, keeping their inboxes free from lender spam.\n\n# **👋 Our Ask**\n\n🏡 Know someone buying a home? Send them to [**getapproval.ai**](http://getapproval.ai). It could help them save thousands.\n\n💬 Know any real estate agents or lenders? We're also looking to connect with real estate agents and loan officers who would be open to sharing feedback. 📩 Connect us at [**hello@getapproval.ai**](mailto:arjun@getapproval.ai)\n\n📲 Want to support? A follow or shoutout on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/approval-ai/) or [X](https://x.com/approval_ai) means the world.\n\nThanks so much for your support. It makes a big difference to us!\n\n# 🤝 **The Team**\n\nApproval AI was founded by ex-Google and first time homebuyers in different cities who bonded over how confusing, expensive, and frustrating getting a mortgage was.\n\n[Arjun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-lalwani/) (CEO) — previously worked as a Product Manager at Google (APM '20), where he led high-impact consumer products. He scaled Google Hotels and launched a new business within YouTube Shopping, growing it from $0 to $XXX million in GMV.  Arjun holds a degree in Computer Science from the University of Washington.\n\n[Helly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hellyshah/) (CTO) — previously worked on Google Maps, leading features that improved lane guidance & geopolitical accuracy for 1B+ users. Before that, she built real-time rates trading systems at Goldman Sachs, shaping how markets move. She grew up in a family of real estate developers across India and the US, giving her a front-row seat to the industry’s inner workings. Helly also holds a degree in Computer Science from the University of Washington.",

    "long_description": "Post-acute agencies lose up to 15% of revenue each year to denials, non-compliant documentation, and delayed payments. Most treat it as a cost of doing business. Instead of waiting weeks for rejections and appealing claims one by one, Claim Health flags issues in real-time and automates claim corrections and appeals—before revenue is lost.\r\n\r\nWhile working with healthcare providers, we found most denials stem from small, preventable documentation errors. As payor requirements grow increasingly complex and fragmented, billing has become a manual, error-prone process. Claim Health closes the loop between documentation and billing outcomes—using AI to detect issues, automate workflows, and recover thousands in missed revenue each week.\r\n\r\nKevin and JJ bring nearly a decade of experience building and scaling healthtech companies. At Dandy, JJ was a founding engineer and Kevin was the first GTM hire; together they helped grow the business from 0 to $150M+ ARR. At Perry (now Jolly), JJ led engineering and Kevin was Head of Sales, driving the company through a $16.5M Series A led by Tesla’s former CFO.\r\n\r\nIn under three weeks since incorporation, we've launched with three agencies and are in early discussions with large U.S. health systems.\r\n\r\nPost-acute care is a $400B market with over $20B in annual revenue leakage due to broken billing workflows. Claim Health is fixing that—starting with denials, and expanding into the full revenue cycle stack.",

We are [Kevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevincalcado/) and [JJ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayenram/) - co-founders of Claim Health, the first AI revenue platform for at-home care. Check out our demo [here](https://youtu.be/NBpZhDoU134):\n\n**The Problem**\n\nHealthcare billing teams are drowning in red tape with ever-changing insurance rules, very manual processes, and siloed data streams.\n\nWe counted 158 clicks to submit a single claim with one of our first customers!\n\n![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNW16bnJybDd0anpsY3luNG5kbGE4dzBwczJvZWhtZXFteWt0MjhrNyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/xUPGcoTKhfDvStjxMA/giphy.gif)\n\nIn our conversations with at-home care providers (think nursing homes, home health, home care, and hospice) providers, Kevin and I kept hearing that “getting money in the door” was the single thing preventing agencies from growing. \\\n\\\nMany home health and home care agencies have to literally say no to patients who need care.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90010&key=user_uploads/545198/3bc40a31-3185-46a7-8fa1-0a4818da0ed3)\n\n**What Claim Health is doing about it**\n\nWe want medical billing to be a **one-click** process. Billers should spend their time making the important decisions and triaging involved in the revenue cycle process.\n\nOur platform surfaces the claims that need attention and automates the submission of the one’s that are routine. In addition, we manage denials by helping billers generate appeal letters and are implementing voice agents to request information enrichment from insurance companies.\n\nOur initial product has been rolled out to early customers and has already\n\n1. turned a 3 day a week billing process to a 2 hour process\n2. found 6 figures in lost revenue from denials and underpayments.\n\nCheck us out at [**claimhealth.ai**](http://claimhealth.ai)\n\n**Know a at-home care agency looking to supercharge their revenue operations?** Connect us → [kevin@claimhealth.ai](https://mailto:kevin@claimhealth.ai) / [Book a demo](https://calendly.com/kevin-claimhealth/30min)\n\n— JJ & Kevin",

        "body": "Hey there 👋\n\nWe’re [Saba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saba-khalilnaji/) and [Shawn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnpatel/), the founders of [Almond](https://almondbot.com/). We’re on a mission to accelerate manufacturing automation with AI-powered robots.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWe’re launching [Almond Bot](https://almondbot.com/bot), a vision-first cobot that ships with the cameras, compute and AI needed to automate vision-based tasks like product inspections and bin picking.\n\n**You can **[**buy**](https://almondbot.com/bot)** Almond Bot today for $7,999.**\n\nCheck out our launch video below 👇\n\n<https://youtu.be/GnelBnYut84>\n\n**The Problem**\n\nIntegrating a robotic solution into a factory costs \\~10x more than the robot itself and takes 90% of the time. The cost is high because robots today rely on precise hardware and fixtures to move from A to B repeatedly. On top of that, programming the robots to account for variations is challenging. For example, if you’re loading a metal block into a CNC machine, and the block isn’t in the exact spot the robot expected it to be, the robot, the block or the CNC could get damaged. Vision systems help but it makes the software even more challenging. How do you tell the robot to pick up the block from an image? There's so much more we can automate in the world today, but it's just too expensive to implement.\n\n**The Solution** \n\nAI lets robots learn from examples. Almond Bot combines a robot, a vision system and AI-ready compute with well-documented APIs to make teaching and programming take minutes instead of days.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdIb1v5w1Ybemq8pNaDyiJ6JKgj4SieFFRxqe0gub5yxzD_9LzrkDc4oWr3NZDn6R7FMAltEmx3Fm26EyUmVc0DT-9sEVdWaiVCx73VrP2Npz2S8us1rUTzvXTJ0UhZD5ZaCW7R?key=H_Wx00jovKE-xyZ1tNmS1PhD)\n\nWith Almond Bot, you can:\n\n✅ Train and run custom object detection models with 2-clicks.

While vector databases have become essential for AI, they fall short when retrieval requires explicit properties or relationships. Existing solutions either bolt vector functionality onto legacy graph databases with poor performance, or force developers to integrate separate systems through middleware, creating overhead and latency bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nBuilt from scratch in Rust, HelixDB leverages world-class expertise in low-level systems programming and algorithms to achieve extreme performance optimizations impossible with existing architectures. This deep technical approach stands in contrast to the LLM-dependent development prevalent in the industry, requiring specialized knowledge in areas where AI tools currently fall short.\r\n\r\nThe timing is optimal: graph databases are finally gaining recognition after two decades of underutilization, while vector databases have proven their AI value but revealed structural limitations. We emerge as the market awakens to hybrid solutions, positioned early enough to capture the opportunity but not so early as to lack ready adopters.",

        "body": "Hi everyone 👋\n\nWe’re [George](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-curtis-12b232a5/) and [Xav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xaviercochran/) – co-founders of [HelixDB](https://www.helix-db.com)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n**HelixDB is an open-source graph-vector database that brings structure to your un-structured data for RAG and AI applications.** Currently, we have hundreds of developers building projects with HelixDB, including a Fortune 500 company.\n\n**_ASK:_** Can you introduce us to people/companies that are working on Graph/Hybrid RAG that could benefit from better performance or less overhead in their development cycles? Contact me at [george@helix-db.com](https://mailto:george@helix-db.com)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V5viTRj2h68\n\n# ❌ The Problem\n\nAI is changing at a rapid rate which is fundamentally changing technology. This new tech **_needs_** new infrastructure.\n\nEveryone is trying to build AI applications, which often involve dedicated data retrieval for their specific use case. Building these retrieval systems is hard. Previously, we’ve relied solely on vector databases to retrieve semantic matches on tiny snippets of text data. But, this technology is shifting and is relying more heavily on connected data, which comes with better context.\n\nBut building these retrieval systems often involve:\n\n1. **Vector databases**\n2. **Graph databases**\n3. Bespoke **middleman/syncing** software\n\nThese setups are complicated, take a lot of time, engineering expertise, and create huge amounts of overhead which makes maintaining them very time consuming and expensive.\n\n# ✅ Our Solution\n\nHelixDB integrates semantic meaning (through its vector types) with relationships to other data (graph types), a similar model to how we structure information in our brains.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90705&key=user_uploads/1342245/468263b3-fb06-4efe-9352-4c30923c6d10)\n\nThis makes it the best solution for making AI retrieval engines for agents and LLMs.\n\nHow we currently do this:\n\n1. Seamlessly integrate **vector types** into your **knowledge graph**\n2. **Type-safe query language** that guides developers and agents to write correct queries before they are executed\n3. **Extreme speeds** outperforming industry leaders by 1-3 orders of magnitude\n\nHow we’re going to make it better:\n\n1. **MCP tools** that allow agents to walk the graph themselves, deciding at each step how to traverse the graph based on the schema and available data.\n2. Built-in **ingestion pipelines** for multi-modal data.\n3. Built-in **embedding-models** bringing immediate structure to your knowledge graph.\n\nTo get setup, follow the guide in our README:\\\n[HelixDB Github](https://github.com/helixdb/helix-db)\n\n# 🙏🏻 Our Ask\n\n* Can you introduce us to people/companies that are working on Graph/Hybrid RAG that could benefit from better performance or less overhead in their development cycles? Get them to [book a call](https://cal.com/georgec/30min) or email [george@helix-db.com](https://mailto:george@helix-db.com)\n* If you have a Github account, then [give us a star 🌟](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db)\n\nYour help and support makes a huge difference for this project. **Thank you!**",

Our software programs robots to execute it.\\\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-jid99QPFA>\n\n# **Problem**\n\nThe biggest scientific breakthroughs -- _think Selman Waksman mining microbes for antibiotics or Akira Yoshino testing early lithium-ion batteries_ _at Sony_ -- started in labs through painful, manual work. **Decades later, discovery still relies on pipetting, weighing, and prepping by hand.**\n\nIt’s inefficient, exhausting, and slows down discovery. Automation solutions exist, but are often **$$$** or built for **specific use cases**. \n\nWe want to change that.\n\n# **Our Take**\n\nWhat if you could run an experiment by just typing it out? \n\nThat’s what we’re building for: **automation that’s usable by everyday scientists.**\n\n# **The Zeon System 🦾**\n\nWe sell a hardware + software system that runs lab experiments using off-the-shelf robotics. **Labs receive a ready-to-run automation setup** that includes:\n\n* Our AI-powered software\n* 2 off-the-shelf robotics arms with mounted depth cameras\n\n_How it works:_\n\n* Scientists describe protocols in plain English\n* Zeon interprets them, detects lab tools using computer vision, and plans the execution\n* The system generates and executes robotic code in real-time, adapting to the specific lab environment\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=89951&key=user_uploads/379901/f18d8421-74dc-4213-8f17-a91419504529)\n\n# **What’s Possible**\n\nWe are already piloting with labs at UCSF and Stanford to:\n\n* Run fluorescence screens for nanoparticles overnight\n* Automate multichannel pipetting for clinical assays\n* Dispose of biohazardous waste while researchers sleep\n\n# **Big Picture**\n\nEventually, we want to **enable labs that run themselves**. Think self-driving labs on Mars or in the middle of the ocean doing science while humans dream. 🪐 🧪🧬\n\n# **The Team**\n\n[Brontë](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bronte-kolar/) built electronic systems for electric aircraft and high-density battery packs before pivoting to computational biology research at UCSF, UC Berkeley, and Erasmus Medical Center. \n\n[Tahir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tahirdme/) has been building software and ML for science labs basically all his adult life, doing computational research at IIT, Yale and working in biotech and pharma across India and the US.\n\n# \n\n# **Our Ask**\n\nWe are looking for **pilot partners** interested in deploying our system in their labs! \n\n* **Know a scientific lab or company that should work with us?** → Email us at [founders@zeonsystems.ai](mailto:founders@zeonsystems.ai) \n* **Resonate with our message?** → Share this post (or our [promo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-jid99QPFA))\n\n—\n\n[_Let’s make science move faster._](https://www.zeonsystems.ai/)\n\n\\-Brontë + Tahir\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=89951&key=user_uploads/379901/3896ab4e-84de-4bfd-ad2e-7fd6f0462be3)\n\n",

Fees account for 3+% of transaction volume, and high-ticket items account for more than a third of the 100 million annual chargebacks in the US.\n\n**With Zenobia Pay, payments cost only 1%, clear instantly, and are protected with a fraud chargeback guarantee**. Customers link their bank to their own hardware, where it’s stored locally in a secure enclave. Merchant sites never see sensitive tokens or account numbers.\n\nFounders Theodore Li and Ryan Prendergast started Zenobia Pay with a mission to make it 3x cheaper to transact online, bypassing the senselessly high credit card interchange fees that aren’t normal anywhere outside the US.\n\nIf you sell goods online for >$200 and want to 3x lower your fees, email us at [merchants@zenobiapay.com](mailto:merchants@zenobiapay.com).

        "body": "Hey everyone! We’re[ Luca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-martial/) and[ Andrey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreyavtomonov/), the cofounders of[ Kaelio](https://kaelio.com/).\n\n**TL;DR**: Healthcare organizations are drowning in dashboards they can't act on - or worse, flying blind because they lack the resources. Kaelio unifies clinical, operational, and financial data for hospitals, health systems, and health plans - giving them an AI copilot that answers business-critical questions, flags operational risks, and recommends actions to improve clinical outcomes and financial performance. We’re currently onboarding our first customers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBqZDSekjbo\n\n# The Problem\n\nHealthcare organizations are sitting on a goldmine of data from EHRs, finance, procurement, staffing, and many more systems. But most of it stays locked away in silos: disconnected, messy, and hard to use.\n\nDecision-makers face two constant struggles: they’re either (1) drowning in dashboards they can’t tactically act on, or (2) flying blind because they don’t have the resources to analyze that data.\n\nSimple, but critical questions like:\n\n* “What was our referral leakage rate in March?”\n* “Are claim denial rates within target thresholds?”\n* “How are our readmission rates trending this month?”\n\noften take days or weeks to answer. Sometimes, they never get answered at all.\n\nThis leads to missed financial opportunities, operational inefficiencies, and worse patient outcomes. Hiring teams of analysts is expensive. Waiting for consultants is too slow. Yet the need for fast, reliable insights is greater than ever.\n\n# **Our Solution**\n\nKaelio acts as a personal analyst copilot for healthcare decision-makers.

    "long_description": "The rapidly growing creator economy ($250B+) consists of millions of solo entrepreneurs still managing complex business finances with spreadsheets and a patchwork of disconnected tools. They face volatile multi-source income, unique business expenses, and daunting U.S. tax obligations: leading to significant stress, lost time, and missed financial opportunities.\r\n\r\nBeluga Labs is building the financial operating system for these modern solopreneurs. Our platform starts with intelligent bookkeeping: we connect all their financial accounts, use AI to automatically categorize income and expenses, and assess their potential tax deductibility, giving creators a clear picture of their business finances and tax preparedness. This core solution, already actively used for expense management and tax Q&A, is the first step. We will rapidly expand to automate quarterly tax filing and payments, then provide integrated tools for S-corp formation and management, payroll, and benefits: truly becoming the 'Rippling for content creators.' Our success means creators save more money, reduce administrative burdens, and can confidently focus on their craft and growth within the creator economy.",

We've worked on AI since the 2010s and in industries where perfect workflows are critical to company survival (Deutsche Bank, Amazon).\n\n# **Problem ❌**\n\nDeep research agents could replace much of white-collar work, but companies can't deploy them because they lack trust in the data sources and control over the reasoning process. Legal and Compliance teams block adoption because existing AI tools make things up.\n\n# **Solution 💡**\n\n[Clarm](https://clarm.com?utm_source=yc&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=launch_yc&utm_id=1) is your AI deep research agent builder for high-trust environments. Our platform connects across 40+ enterprise integrations - CRMs, email, knowledge bases - and lets you build precise, repeatable workflows that transform how teams work without the risk.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90682&key=user_uploads/2476585/fc020dbb-e97a-4980-b074-69a20242c1ef)\n\nWe’re actively developing [Clarm](https://clarm.com?utm_source=yc&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=launch_yc&utm_id=1) for customers such as:\n\n* law firms to find relevant information within the thousands of emails and documents\n* asset managers to evaluate proxy voting preferences across 90,000 shareholder meetings\n* luxury goods retailers to increase client response rate from 5% to 50% through deep personalization (as compared to standard Hubspot-generated marketing copy)\n* fast-growing startups to onboard new hires instantly with bespoke training material created on their own customer calls\n* top open source startups to increase engagement with their Github repo and knowledge base\n* services firms to instantly answer '000s of client support questions, driving up engagement and turning curious prospects into committed customers\n\nhttps://youtu.be/on2OVIuO62M\n\n# **Team 👏**\n\nMarcus led the first AI team at a major Corporate Bank, growing it to $10m ARR in 2 years. After a Visiting Research Fellowship at the University of Oxford, he built the world’s most accurate consumer goods forecasting model for the world’s largest market researcher, scaling it from 0 to $7m ARR in 2 years. Marcus has worked all over the world and speaks 8 languages (on a good day).\n\nAlex built and maintained payment systems at Amazon Prime Video, processing $bns per year. He was top of his class at Imperial College London and holds numerous industry awards and publications.\n\n# **Our ask 🙏**\n\nWe’d like intros to buyers at high trust firms, like finance, luxury, and law.\n\nWe’d also be open to working with you directly if you sell into these firms and need precise, on-prem deep research agents to power your products.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

        "body": "Hey everyone! We’re [Siddhartha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhartha-javvaji-23b81617a) and [Pratham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prathamhombal/), co-founders of [Stratify](https://www.trystratify.com) and we’re saving companies millions by helping them understand their users better.\n\n# **TL;DR**\n\nFailing to understand _what_ your users truly want can kill a company. Stratify uses AI agentic workflows to instantly recruit participants, conduct dynamic user interviews, analyze responses, and provide actionable feedback. With simple queries like \"What do users think of our new checkout flow?\" or “Which prototype resonates most with users?”, Stratify delivers authentic customer feedback within a few hours.\n\n[Stratify Launch Video](https://youtu.be/j0Py7pKyuy4)\n\n---\n\n# **🤦‍♂️ The User Research Problem**\n\n**Here's the brutal truth**: 90% of product failures happen because teams don't truly understand their users. You can’t really blame them because traditional user research **is broken**:\n\n1. **💸 Focus groups are expensive:** $15K+ for 8 people in a room for 2 hours. Half of them drop out last minute, and you're left wondering if these insights represent your actual users.\n2. **📅 Manual interviews take weeks:** Booking user interviews feels like herding cats. Calendars stay empty for weeks while your launch deadline approaches. And big ideas _cannot_ wait.\n3. **📝 Surveys are unresponsive and impersonal:** Generic forms with dropdown menus can't capture the _why_ behind user behavior. You get some data, but absolutely no story.\n\n**The result?** Teams ship based on assumptions, not insights. Features flop. Users churn. Millions of dollars wasted.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90668&key=user_uploads/2549216/0e975083-d540-4aed-91ac-ea337164777b)\n\n---\n\n# **✨ Introducing Stratify**\n\nWhat if you could ask \"What do users think of our new product?\" and get answers from hundreds of real users in under a few hours? That's exactly what Stratify does.\n\n1. **🚀 Define your Research Questions:**\n\n   Simply describe what you want to learn about your product or upload product materials: _\"How do millennials feel about our pricing?\"_ Our vetted AI researcher transforms your query into a comprehensive study framework in seconds.\n2. **🎯 Smart Participant Matching:**\n\n   Set demographic and behavioral parameters or simply specify a query like \"U.S., Gen Z, Online Shopper, Foodie\". Our AI automatically finds the perfect participants from our network of millions of real users or directly within your own company’s customers.\n3. **🎥 Uncover Real Insights:**\n\n   Watch our AI agents conduct hundreds of interviews simultaneously, asking follow-up questions that dynamically adapt to each participant’s unique responses. Uncover the _why_ behind user behaviors that surveys and focus groups miss completely.\n4. **🧠 Instant Analysis:**\n\n   Transform hours of interview content into actionable intelligence instantly. Search conversations semantically, generate reports and slides presentations, or simply chat with your data to find exactly what you need to know.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n# **🎉 Our Ask**\n\n* **🚀 Building something new?** Try Stratify before your next feature launch, whether that’s your website, onboarding flow, product prototypes, etc. It could save you months of building the wrong thing—seriously.\n* **💬 Know any product managers, product designers, or founders?** They'd love this. User research is their biggest pain point.\n* **🙌 Support us** with a follow or share. Every bit helps us reach more teams who are tired of guessing what users want.\n\n---\n\n# **👥 The Team**\n\n[**Siddhartha**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhartha-javvaji-23b81617a) (CEO) and [**Pratham**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prathamhombal) (CTO) have studied computer science at Stanford, where they’ve conducted AI and high performance compute research at renowned labs. They met in their freshman dorm at Stanford and have been roommates and building together since.\n\nThey’ve been in your shoes. They’ve launched features that flopped, ignored user feedback until it was too late, and learned the hard way that assumptions kill products. Now they’re making sure no other team has to learn it the hard way.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n**_Users have opinions. Are you listening?_**\n\n* **Try Stratify:** [https://www.trystratify.com](https://www.trystratify.com/%5C)\n* **Questions?:** [sid@trystratify.com](mailto:sid@trystratify.com) & [pratham@trystratify.com](mailto:pratham@trystratify.com)\n\n ",

        "body": "Hey everyone! We’re [Achyut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/achyut-byanjankar/), [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-yu-871202244/), and [Soami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soamikapadia/) from [YouLearn](https://www.youlearn.ai/).\n\n# **TL;DR**\n\nYouLearn is an AI tutor personalized to each student. In the last **eight months**, we’ve grown from **$1K to $70K MRR**, with **150,000 monthly active users**, by providing concise notes, an AI tutor you can talk to, and personalized tests based on your learning materials.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wVkQXY49JiE\n\n# **📍 How we started**\n\nWe met two weeks into college and started hacking on projects in our dorm. By sophomore year, we were fed up with watching **long, outdated lecture videos** and reading **dense textbooks**, only to forget a few days later. Generic AI tools gave **quick answers**, but those shortcuts left us with only **surface-level understanding**. We kept **cramming before exams**, forgetting most of it soon after, and repeating the same cycle.\n\n# **💻 What we built**\n\nOut of that frustration, we built **YouLearn**. Upload any learning material, and YouLearn turns it into **clear notes**, an **AI tutor** that walks you through the topic, and **adaptive quizzes** to help you remember. Learning is now **faster, easier, and more memorable.**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90256&key=user_uploads/1378551/166ca331-2283-486c-a7a4-074ae4ea4c86)\n\n# **🧑‍🎓 Why students choose YouLearn**\n\n* **Designed by students, for students:** As recent undergrads, we lived the stress of college life, so we built YouLearn’s AI tutor and quizzes to solve these challenges.\n* **Everything in one place:** One upload instantly delivers notes, an AI tutor, and quizzes. No more bouncing between ChatGPT, Quizlet, Notion, etc.\n* **Made for exam success:** Take practice tests with full answer breakdowns, track your progress, and pinpoint your weak spots (e.g, “Review Page 42, paragraph 1”).\n\n# **📚 Building a better way to study**\n\nToday, over **150,000 students use YouLearn each month** to study smarter, with more than **2.2 million+ learning materials uploaded.** One med student told us he didn’t think AI could do this until he started **acing exams with perfect scores** across multiple courses. His friend jumped from **60% to 90%** using YouLearn, and now **four of his classmates have upgraded**. As he puts it:\n\n> I got better grades than people that went to class. Because literally for me, it's my tutor.\n\nThis is just the start. We believe **every student will have a personal AI tutor**, and we’re building the one they’ll never want to miss a class on.\n\n# **🙏 Our ask**\n\nIf you're a student or learning something new, try [YouLearn](https://www.youlearn.ai/) and share your feedback at [founders@youlearn.ai](mailto:founders@youlearn.ai) :)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90256&key=user_uploads/1378551/18df7d7a-a9b5-4b1a-8c1b-aeeba480dab8)\n\n",

We noticed our teacher used Scantron for multiple choice questions, but there was nothing to help her grade written work.\n\nWe kept seeing tools that totally missed the mark, shifting the workload from downloading/uploading and copy pasting feedback, so we decided to bring AI into the LMS.\n\nWe don’t replace teachers. We help you, help your students :)\n\n**🙏 Our ask:** If you answer “yes” to any of these, we’d love your help!\n\n* Do you know any teachers who grade a lot of written work?\n* Can you intro us to any elementary, middle, or high schools?\n\n**Contact us at** [**daniel@vibegrade.com**](mailto:daniel@vibegrade.com) **and** [**share our website!**](https://vibegrade.com)\n\nOur mission is to make education better for everyone, so your help can make a huge difference.\n\n**Thank you!**",

Customers frequently use different identifiers for items, different units, and close but not quite the same descriptors. Employees aren't just copy-pasting (or manually typing) PDF data into an ERP, they have to validate every item in the ERP.\r\n\r\nWith Percival, businesses can just email customer POs and other requests to a dedicated @percivaltech.com email address. Once the request is handled, Percival responds to the email with the result: whether that's an order number in the ERP or a list of prices.",

        "title": "Mbodi AI- Embodied AI for Industrial Robotics",
        "body": "Hey friends [👋](https://emojipedia.org/waving-hand)\n\nThis is [Xavier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavierchi/) and [Sebastian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebbyjp/) - Co-Founders of Mbodi AI, and we are making robots learn like humans.\n\n# **TL;DR**\n\n**We’re building an embodied AI platform that lets anyone teach robots new skills — just by talking to them.** No code. No engineers. No week-long reprogram. Mbodi turns natural language and quick demos into precise, reliable robot actions that run in production in minutes, and adapt as often as you need.\n\nWe are now rolling out real-world deployments to customers with a joint commercialization partner, [ABB](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics), the world’s leading robot manufacturer.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CwRxP3_F9MA\n\n# 🚨 **The Problem**\n\nManufacturing is facing a critical inflection point.\n\n**Labor crisis:** Labor accounts for nearly half of global GDP ($40+ trillion), but over 70% of factories face severe labor shortages.\n\n**Flexibility gap:** Traditional robots require week-long reprogramming by engineers or specialists every time things change.\n\n**Untapped automation potential:** Hundreds of billions of dollars in manufacturing tasks, especially those with high variation, remain out of reach for automation because robots can’t adapt fast enough.\n\nThis mismatch, between inflexible robots and ever-shifting production needs, leaves a massive automation gap across global manufacturing. We simply need robots to be more **versatile**. It wasn’t quite possible — **until now**.\n\n# **🧠 How Mbodi AI Helps**\n\nMbodi is an embodied AI platform that makes robots learn like humans, with natural language. So anyone can teach robots new skills by talking to them and execute the learned skills reliably in production, in minutes.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90633&key=user_uploads/1111983/cd7897e7-4fc9-4137-8c3d-2b6fe0b487bb)\n\nWe’ve built a cloud-to-edge system that takes your instructions, understands the environment, makes a plan, and turns it into precise, safe robot actions. All within a second. Our universal agent framework can run across any robotic hardware, coordinating perception, reasoning, planning, and control in real time.\n\n* 🕐 No week-long reprograms\n* 👷‍♂️ No on-site engineers\n* 🗣️ Just say what you want done\n* 🏭 Run reliably in production\n\nWhen one robot learns something, the entire fleet does. Individual skills can be reused, repurposed, and adapted instantly — across machines, factories, and tasks.\n\n# 🚀 **What’s Happening**\n\nWe’re moving toward real-world deployments after entering a joint commercialization agreement with ABB Robotics, one of the world’s leading robot manufacturers, following our win in their global AI Startup Challenge from among hundreds. This represents a first-of-its-kind system in industrial automation.\n\nWe’re building toward a world where robots are as easy to teach and adapt as software — turning them into true consumer commodities and making automation accessible to every factory and beyond.\n\n# 📣 **Our Ask**\n\nIf you're a **manufacturer**, **system integrator**, or **robot maker** exploring more flexible and intelligent automation, we’d love to connect and solve automation challenges that were previously out of reach.\n\nReach us at: [**founders@mbodi.ai**](mailto:founders@mbodi.ai)\n\nWe’re also strong advocates of the open-source community. We open-sourced one of our libraries, [embodied-agents](https://github.com/mbodiai/embodied-agents), to enable seamless integration of transformer models into robotics stacks, with more open-source projects coming in the future.\n\n# 👥 **The Team**\n\n[Xavier (Tianhao) Chi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavierchi/) is a former tech lead of Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8), one of the world’s most critical internet services, with work featured in[ The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/19/google_dns_queries/) and topping[ Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39960125). He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in ECE from UIUC.\n\n[Sebastian Peralta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebbyjp/) is a physicist, roboticist, and deep learning researcher. Before Mbodi, he was a core engineer at Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8), and earned a triple major (EE, CS, Physics) from UPenn, where he also conducted graduate research at the GRASP Robotics Lab.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90633&key=user_uploads/1111983/87381bac-5704-43f6-9fa3-1796b4af0f53)\n\nWe started Mbodi after seeing robots fall short of their potential — stuck in brittle code and long deployment cycles. With breakthroughs in generative AI and agentic systems, we’re building a future where robots can truly learn, adapt, and scale.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90633&key=user_uploads/1111983/447ef918-87d3-4a90-a120-04274434878f)\n\n",

My family's store was started over 100 years ago, and with this industry experience, Prateek and I are able to offer new insights.\\\n[Overview](https://youtu.be/VEAZGZZ4_RU) \\\n**The Problem: Operating an independent grocery store means surviving on razor-thin margins.**\n\n* 3 % of sales vanish due to shrinkage.\n* Out of stocks wipe out 4% more in lost sales\n* Slip-and-fall hazards lead to liability risks.\n* These slim margins prevent grocers from hiring back office staff.\n\n**What We Built-**\n\n* 24/7 Theft Detection – Real-time alerts when someone crosses the “no-go” zones behind registers or swipes merchandise.\n* Safety Monitoring – Automatic slip-and-fall hazard spotting so you can fix risks before they become claims.\n* Shelf & Stock Insights – Instant out-of-stock notifications to keep product levels optimized.\n* Pricing Research - Soon we will introduce an agentic workflow to manage one of grocers' most tedious tasks, looking up competitors prices.\n\n**Our Team-**\n\n* Nic Sleeper, CEO – Former SWE at PredictionStrike.\n* Prateek Pinisetti, CTO – Ex-Optiver SWE and chess National Master; real-time systems expert.\n* We met as Harvard roommates, did psets together in our dorm, and have been collaborating ever since.\n\n\\*\\*The Vision-\\*\\*\\\nWe chose to work in this space to help local grocers thrive in the AI age and be on the forefront of innovation.

        "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeSgstuYYwQ\n\n**_We’re building general purpose AI agents for our government, starting with Congress. Our vision is simple: a future where public servants work at the speed of thought, empowered by a system that understands their workflows, integrates with all their tools, and eliminates the friction of fragmented software._**\n\n### **❌ The Problem**\n\nGovernment work is critical for our country, but across federal, state, and local agencies, it’s being slowed to a crawl by outdated software, siloed systems, and manual processes. Every day, public servants spend hours on repetitive, low-leverage tasks: retyping information across systems, routing emails between departments, tracking sentiment in spreadsheets, and responding to routine inquiries in Word docs. The tools they rely on rarely integrate. Critical data is fragmented. When someone calls about a missing VA check or a passport delay, staffers often re-enter the same information multiple times, and real help can take days or even weeks to arrive\n\nThis isn't just inefficiency. It is a **_failure_** at scale. And it’s because no software truly wraps around the way government employees work.\n\n### **💡 The Solution**\n\n**Caucus is the last piece of software government workers will ever need.**\n\nWe’re building general purpose AI agents that integrate across the tools and workflows government employees already use, starting with congressional offices. This won’t just increase government efficiency, but it will empower a more responsive government, better connecting Americans to the services and representation they deserve. Our goal is to become _the last piece of software the American government will ever need._\n\n### **🧠 Why Now**\n\nGovernment employees are under immense pressure: workloads are growing, staffing levels are stretched thin, and the demands of modern governance are becoming more dynamic and fast moving.\n\nWe’re not building another CRM. We're building Cursor for government, where AI agents are the connective tissue between humans and every app they use.\n\n### **📖 Our Story**\n\nWe started Caucus after seeing the everyday chaos inside congressional offices. Despite their best efforts, staffers are buried in busywork, slowed down by tools that don’t serve them. [Amir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theamirfarahani/) built and sold Turbo Legi, an AI platform for legislative solutions, to FiscalNote (NYSE: NOTE) before finishing undergrad. [Tyler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-chen-43570b241/), a Yale Physics + CS student, brought technical firepower from machine learning labs, quantum computing research, and building AI voice tools for a series D startup. Amir and Tyler grew up together and have known each other their entire lives, since kindergarten and toddlerhood. Years later, Amir pitched Tyler the vision for Caucus while he was still at Yale, and they’ve been building it together ever since\n\nNo one was building the last mile of software for the people who keep our government running. \n\n**_So we are._**\n\n### **❓FAQ**\n\n**Who is Caucus for?**\\\nGovernment employees: starting with congressional offices and soon expanding across agencies, departments, and local governments.\n\n**What does it do?**\\\nCaucus embeds AI agents into every government workflow.\n\n**How is this different from existing government software?**\\\nCaucus _isn’t_ software in the traditional sense. It’s the connective layer across all software, a general purpose agent that works with the tools you already use, at the moment you need them, without disrupting your workflow. Think: Cursor, but for the government.\n\n**What does the Congressional product do?**\\\nThe Congressional product is an AI platform purpose built for House and Senate offices. It automates constituent communication and casework through website chatbots and phone based voice agents that answer policy questions, collect casework details (including signed privacy forms), and route structured summaries to staff. We are cutting down the time it takes to help constituents from over a week to minutes. A secure dashboard surfaces real-time trends and constituent sentiment. By handling repetitive tasks instantly and accurately, Caucus empowers staffers to focus on complex casework and legislative priorities, without requiring any changes to their existing workflows.\n\n**Can Caucus help with federal, state, and local governments?**\\\nAbsolutely. While we are starting with congressional offices, Caucus is built to scale across agencies, federal, state, and local governments. Whether it's a city council or a federal agency, we’re making it easier for government employees at all levels to serve our country more effectively.\n\n### **🤝 Our Ask**\n\nKnow anyone in our government? Especially congressional staffers, agency employees, or department heads? We’re actively onboarding and would love introductions.\n\nDrop me a line at [amir@usecaucus.com](mailto:amir@usecaucus.com), check us out at [www.getcaucus.com](http://www.getcaucus.com), or visit[ www.usecaucus.com](http://www.usecaucus.com) for our congressional products.\n\n**Let’s build the last piece of software the American government will ever need.**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90277&key=user_uploads/1649746/dd1f3e9f-a8f1-4617-9151-515f8c267aa7)\n\n",

        "body": "Hey YC,\n\nI’m Lev and I invented time travel… for your database.\n\n“Huh?”\n\n**TLDR:** PgDog is a proxy for scaling PostgreSQL. It can load balance traffic and shard databases, without changes to app code or using database extensions. What does this have to do with time travel? Keep reading.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trSVJel3gyc\n\n# ❌ The Problem\n\nScaling Postgres is a full time job. Your app is writing data but the database can’t keep up. You’re adding more databases and thinking of breaking the app into services to spread the load.\n\nPgDog is for you if:\n\n* You had an outage caused by a bad query\n* Your database is unpredictable; app latency and uptime are all over the place\n* You know more about Postgres internals (like vacuum) than you’d like, and you just want it to work so you can go back to building your product\n\nAnd you catch yourself day dreaming about the good old days, when you were pre-PMF and your DB was at 10% CPU.\n\n# 👷 The Solution\n\nDatabase problems should be solved at the database layer. PgDog is a load balancer, connection pooler, bouncer, and sharder. It speaks fluent SQL and understands every single Postgres query. It uses this knowledge to:\n\n* Distribute queries between shards, horizontally scaling your relational database\n* Load balance traffic between replicas\n* Block or rewrite queries you don’t like, e.g. queries that forgot an index or are missing the customer_id and were about to leak data\n\nWith PgDog, your DB is young again and ready to grow 10x. Written in Rust, for security and performance, PgDog is fully tested and ready for production.\n\n# 🙏 The Ask\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, **get in touch!** I’m happy to come work for you to fix your DB. I’ll stay in the basement and make PgDog scale Postgres, while you work on your startup.\n\nYou’re my ideal design partner if:\n\n* Postgres is your production database (naturally)\n* Despite your troubles, you love it and want to do more with it\n* You believe in first principles solutions to hard problems\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90596&key=user_uploads/989617/91f087f7-4175-47fe-9753-57ed4e9bda62)\n\nEmail [lev@pgdog.dev](mailto:lev@pgdog.dev), join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CcBZkjSJdd), and give us a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/pgdogdev/pgdog). Everything we build is open source.\n\n# 👬 The Team\n\nI’m a second time technical founder (previously co-founded [PostgresML](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml)) and started the Instacart storage infra team. I scaled 100TB+ databases when Instacart grew 5x in 3 months. This is my second pet-inspired project for scaling Postgres (have you heard of [pgcat](https://github.com/postgresml/pgcat)?)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90596&key=user_uploads/989617/86ff8181-b991-4bf9-bd05-8b0a387ed978)\n\n",

There we realized AI can completely disrupt the $50B Work Management Market, but it required a fresh start.\r\n\r\nWhat work we even choose to manage in the first place is critical, and the most important insights from customers are silo-ed in sales/CS while R&D gives their best shot at roadmaps meant to deliver impact. Significant requests sit in a backlog, duplicate asks flood the system, months wasted on \"strategic investments\". We want to bridge this gap.\r\n\r\nThis message is resonating with heads of sales, heads of product, CEOs, as well as individuals, all trying to make sure the most important things get done, with less wasted effort and more revenue/retention.\r\n\r\nKestral works by automatically take in customer data like sales call transcripts & feature request messages and a team of agents:\r\n1. analyze them for actionable takeaways, deal blockers, and nice to haves\r\n2. consolidate them and manage all the asks with citations\r\n3. prioritize them by impact and frequency to cut through the noise so you can see the biggest opportunities clearly\r\n4. connect them to your existing strategic roadmap so when the work gets done, we can automatically follow back up with your customers and win them over\r\n\r\nThis is just step one of our mission to revolutionize how work gets done -- starting with what we choose to work on, and hope you follow us along for the ride!",

        "body": "Hey YC, we’re [Brian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-y-kim-16b7aa63/) and [Bernard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiebernard), and we’re building [Kestral](https://kestral.team/), your AI Work Prioritizer!\n\n**TLDR;** We make it clear what matters most to your customers and your business to guarantee your work has impact. (how? gotta read more)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/R8Q5qOWRv2I\n\n# **❌ The Problem** 😟\n\nCompanies spend too much money on Sales and R&D teams just for them to 🥤**suck🥤** at communicating with each other and this costs millions of dollars in blocked deals, churned customers, and time wasted on irrelevant roadmaps.\n\nThere’s gold in customer data in all its forms, yet even the most revered companies we talked to commonly lose sight of blockers and spend hours updating spreadsheets of feature requests.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90532&key=user_uploads/12690/c0a42d49-4b96-4711-b33e-50ebfa2b1d41)\n\n📣 “We have deep anxiety if we’re deploying our product teams appropriately…” - C-Suite @ a Public Company\\\n📣 “All my calls… in Gong. Feature requests … in Notion. We’ve got Salesforce. Why, in 2025, am I still grepping around for feature requests like a caveman?” - Head of Sales @ a Series B Startup\\\n📣 “… we’re tracking feature requests on spreadsheets” - GTM @ a Major LLM Provider\n\nCompanies KNOW they should do better… but without the right tools, they are:\n\n* Getting outmaneuvered by competitors by failing to adapt to customer trends as they come up\n* Wasting hours manually tracking and escalating tasks that end up sitting in a backlog\n* Worrying if users will care about their “strategic investments”.\n\n# 💭 📖 **The Solution**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90532&key=user_uploads/12690/7fd4ffb6-0954-4fb8-b661-3063088bae79)\n\nWe instantly bridge this divide between customer-facing roles and product development by:\n\n1\\. Extracting ALL actionable tasks from a variety of sources (transcripts, Slack/Discord messages, GitHub issues…)\n\n2\\. Consolidating duplicate asks and prioritizing them by theme\n\n3\\. (optionally syncing to project management platforms like Linear/Notion until we displace them…)\n\n4\\. Closing the loop with them, so you go from feature launch to immediate customer engagement & guaranteed impact\n\n**We’re building teams of AI agents that:**\n\n🤖 - understand the context of roles, projects, companies, and customers\n\n🤖 - rank work on various heuristics like opportunity size, effort, and team goals\n\n🤖 - make direct connections between customer asks and R&D’s work\n\n🤖 - personally follow up with users or revitalize the pipeline to guarantee a positive business impact of work\n\nOur technology can also easily transition to save orgs countless hours by eliminating work about work, like updating the state of tasks from meeting transcripts/messages and giving status updates while reprioritizing.\n\n# 🤜💥🤛 **The Team**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90532&key=user_uploads/12690/f58ce5b7-6361-4c95-9035-6fd470b271d3)\n\n(pre-YC vacation together in Jeju)\n\nWe’re close friends since college and multiple-time founding members of prior startups. We recently crossed paths at Asana, where Brian was an AI Tech Lead, while Bernie led Enterprise Authorization projects.\n\nWe’re leveraging our experience to combine the cutting edge of memory and knowledge base management with AI Agent Permissions for Enterprise to build the future of work.\n\nWe fully understand that work management structures are crucial to providing the necessary context for AI to deliver real enterprise value, and we’re not scared of any existing players in this space.\n\n# 💡 The Opportunity\n\nOur mandate is to disrupt the work management industry that has a **$50B TAM**, but we’re starting first by truly understanding and prioritizing what a company works on. As agents get better and commoditized, we aim to be best positioned to help companies get the work done faster.\n\nThe existing tools in this space can charge 5-6 figures a year for speculative and limited insights from customers at best, and they don’t even make the connection to R&D’s real work. We can instantly help validate/derisk costly roadmap plans, as well as help companies adapt to their customers’ needs immediately, providing millions in value.\n\nWe’re also personally seeing some very large investments (millions) in hiring teams to build internal systems to try to connect impact to work that is still manual at heart. Our partner said that if you’re seeing someone build something painful just for themselves… you’re on to something.\n\n### 🟠 CALLING THE YC COMMUNITY 🧡\n\nWe’d love to meet more of you!\\\n🗣️ In a CRO, Sales, GTM, or Customer Success role, and want your requests prioritized? \\\n🗣️ Product Leader wanting to validate your strategy and get measurable results?\\\n🗣️ Building the latest in AI knowledge bases and memory?\n\nLet’s talk!\\\n\\\nWould appreciate any **warm intros** to the above as well! We’re looking for partners to grow _with us_ to become the most efficient, most _actually_ customer-centric companies in the world.\\\n\\\nHit us up at [founders@kestral.team](mailto:founders@kestral.team) or book a demo call, even if you’re just a little curious at https://kestral.team\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90532&key=user_uploads/12690/a70b5c3b-593a-4a99-87a0-e8eb5e72e44e)\n\n",

Turns out, **so was everyone else** building voice agents. \n\n**Solution:** So, we built a platform that **does 100x the testing we could ever do, in minutes.** From there: fix the bug laundry list, re-run Bluejay’s test suite, and push to prod[.](https://youtu.be/bpWu_0TWIP4)\n\n**Think about it:** SaaS has robust, feature-rich E2E testing platforms, CI/CD, and regression testing. _Why don’t AI voice agents have the same?_\n\nFor us, building Bluejay wasn’t a “let’s see if this works” idea. \n\nIt was a no-brainer. \n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Mimic: Hyper-realistic Customer Simulations:** Generate a custom workforce of **digital humans** to test every conversational turn of your voice agent. Our digital humans speak/have varied languages, accents, background noise, tone, delivery, emotion, and vocal punctuation. They’re better at being customers than your real customers…\n* **Skywatch: Production Observability:** Another no brainer. Why stop at testing your agents pre-production? We tell you what went wrong with production calls, and how to fix it.\n* **Research-backed Evaluation:** Bluejay learns about your agent’s goals, and tells you how close it got to achieving them. And of course, the standard stuff: latency, redundancy, hallucination, tool calls, interruptions, sentiment… anything worth knowing, really.\n\nVoice agents **_need_** automated, scalable testing. And we won’t stop at voice. \n\n**The Team:**\n\n[Rohan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanvas/) is ex-AWS Bedrock, and went to UChicago studying CS + Econ. He built a profitable SaaS company in college.\n\n[Faraz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farazmsiddiqi/) is ex-Microsoft Copilot, and did his undergrad/masters in CS at UIUC, where he researched high quality synthetic data generation and context compression for LLMs.\n\n**Do us a solid:**\n\nIf you are building voice agents, give us a shot:[ ](https://getbluejay.ai/)[https://getbluejay.ai](https://getbluejay.ai%5B.%5D\\(https://getbluejay.ai/\\))[.](https://getbluejay.ai/)\n\nOr, book a call here:[ https://cal.com/rohanv.](https://cal.com/rohanv)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90520&key=user_uploads/1376037/a4ba8c15-48ca-4c91-aa17-0a3754baf70f)\n\n",

It lets you roll your own auth directly on your backend and database, without relying on 3rd party services. From basic sign-ins to complex enterprise systems all with great DX.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_HjHmprVOs\n\nAuth has been a pain point for many developers in the TypeScript ecosystem for a while. Other open-source libraries require a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. So, we set out to build a comprehensive auth library - framework-agnostic, with a robust set of features out of the box, a plugin ecosystem for everything else you might need, and great documentation.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90320&key=user_uploads/1184116/dec3dc74-8395-4d83-b062-c2f3271b8164)\n\nSince launching v1 just 5 months ago:\n\n* **13K+ GitHub stars** and **350K+ monthly npm downloads**\n* We've grown into one of the **most influential** and **well-loved** open source projects in the TypeScript ecosystem.\n* Used in production by great teams including YC companies and major OSS projects including [folo](https://github.com/RSSNext/Folo), [same](https://same.new/), [dokploy](https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy), [zero](https://github.com/Mail-0/Zero), [onejs](https://github.com/onejs/one) and many more.\n* We’re the recommended auth library by **Next.js, Nuxt, Astro**, and other top JS frameworks.\n* A thriving community with **5K+ members on Discord,** **7K+ followers on X**, and a growing ecosystem of adjacent libraries built by community members.\n* Featured by creators like Theo, Dev Ed and more\n\nTo take it further, and after seeing the pain points of our current users, we're building an **infrastructure layer** on top of the framework to extend the library with functionality we can't offer through the framework alone:\n\n* A comprehensive admin dashboard with user management & analytics\n* Bot/fraud/abuse detection\n* Global session storage\n* and more…\n\nTo be clear – we’re not building a third-party auth service. Our goal is to make rolling your own auth so ridiculously easy that you’ll never need one.\n\nGet started with the library here: [better-auth.com/docs/installation](http://better-auth.com/docs/installation)\n\nJoin the waitlist for infra: http://better-auth.build/\n\nStar the repo: https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth",

        "body": "Hi everyone, we’re [Max](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwhofer/) and [Greg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gergely-csegzi/), and we’re building [Parsewise](https://parsewise.ai/) 👋\n\n👉🏻 Watch the video: https://youtu.be/ZFNH0M6Q3fw\n\n**❌ The Problem**\n\nBusiness experts waste hours each week on **manual, repetitive data tasks**. Extracting and validating information from complex documents is slow and error-prone. As a result, analytics, benchmarking, and reporting **processes are brittle and expensive**.\n\n**Current AI solutions** like ChatGPT are black boxes that generate **unreliable outputs**. Intelligent document processing tools require technical expertise, resulting in limited productivity gains.\n\n**The data monkey era is over!** We believe that business experts have struggled with complex documents long enough. We 10x their productivity while improving the quality of their outputs.\n\n**✅ The Parsewise Solution**\n\nParsewise extracts trusted information from complex documents, supported by these core features:\n\n* **End-to-end Traceability**: We trace every single output (text, number, date, etc.) to its exact source and highlight it with bounding boxes. _No more black boxes._\n* **Granular Human Control**: Business experts directly review and modify data extraction logic and consistency check strategies. _No more re-prompting._\n* **Exhaustive Processing**: Our agents exhaustively parse data, proactively flagging issues. _No more second-guessing._\n\n👉🏻 Parsewise is easy to use: https://youtu.be/69kEn5cYbvA\n\n**💬 What Our Users Are Saying**\n\n_“We have cut the analysis process from weeks to days, and most importantly, we have more confidence in the results than before.”_\n\n* Head of Family Office\n\n_“The processing took a while, but the results are perfect. We ran the same test with Snowflake’s Document AI, and it was frankly disappointing.”_\n\n* Lead Data Analyst at a Large Asset Manager\n\nWe have helped **cut week-long processes relying on parsing complex documents into hours**.\n\n**🤝 The Team**\n\nWe met studying CS at Oxford University in 2017.\n\n**Max (CEO)**: Ran his first business at 12, founded a data science consultancy next to his PhD, and conducted >20 PE due diligence projects at Bain. BSc, MSc, and PhD in CS and Econ.\n\n**Greg (CTO)**: Built the earliest production AI use cases at Palantir, with top project conversion, working in life sciences and insurance, having been deployed to 6 countries. Ask me about parsing manga-style insurance documents 😉\n\n**🚀 Call to Action: Free a Data Monkey**\n\nWe’re **live with pilot customers**, looking to **free more human data monkeys** of their lousy work!\n\nThe most relevant industries and teams are:\n\n* Industries: Investment management, reinsurance, life sciences\n* Teams: Risk & compliance, analytics, data & AI engineers\n\nContact us at [founders@parsewise.ai](mailto:founders@parsewise.ai) for more information and a demo.",

We help you measure performance and define rewards for reinforcement learning.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56LpwoPxqjc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56LpwoPxqjc%5C)\n\nEvaluating model performance is an opaque art and vanilla LLM judges do not provide the necessary signal to measure output quality. Additionally, modern GRPO-style RL techniques offer rapid, generalizable improvements to model performance, but they require well-specified eval datasets to be used as rewards. We help you quickly specify high signal evals across a variety of unstructured tasks with aligned graders, fine-grained rubrics and fast iteration.\\\n\\\nOur eval workspace – [**doteval**](https://www.doteval.com/) – offers a Cursor-like experience to edit evals-as-code against our .yaml schema. Version evals across checkpoints, replace manual effort with AI-generated diffs, and compare eval runs on tight-execution loops to align them with your IP. This way, you can confidently determine whether you should upgrade to Claude 4 or stay on Gemini 2.5 Pro, or whether this new 12,000 word prompt actually creates net improvement over that 8,000 word prompt. You can also one-click export the spec to be used as the training set for RL and post-train your own model.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90688&key=user_uploads/2567589/e6c9c568-81ef-4057-bdff-4ad49982f76c)\n\n\\\nToday, we work with frontier AI teams to benchmark performance for complex model tasks.

    "long_description": "Tinfoil makes it easy to make your AI workloads provably private, without changing your code. You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don’t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA’s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil’s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don’t log your queries.” Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user — not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it’s processed on. \r\n\r\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\r\n\r\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\r\n\r\nIf OpenAI is creating “God in a box”, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can’t spy.",

        "title": "Tinfoil: Verifiable Privacy for Cloud AI",
        "body": "Sending your most sensitive or proprietary data to OpenAI et al?\n\nSick of deals getting stalled during enterprise or government security reviews?\n\nHate deploying on various configurations of on-prem infrastructure environments?\n\nSay less ✋\n\nWe’re [Tanya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-verma-130a23124/), [Jules](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdrean/), [Sacha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sacha-servan-schreiber-308341305/) and [Nate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-sales/) from[ Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.sh/). What we’re building at Tinfoil sidesteps these concerns because we can host models while guaranteeing zero data access and retention.\n\nWe let you run powerful models like Llama, Deepseek R1 on cloud GPUs without you having to trust us – or the cloud provider – with your private data.\n\nSince AI performs better the more context you give it, we think solving AI privacy will unlock more valuable AI applications, just how TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish knowing that your credit card info wouldn't be stolen by someone sniffing internet packets.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wnwI22qT-QQ\n\n**Who we are**\n\nWe come from backgrounds in cryptography, security, and infrastructure. Jules did his PhD in trusted hardware and confidential computing at MIT, and worked with NVIDIA and Microsoft Research on the same, Sacha did his PhD in privacy-preserving cryptography at MIT, Nate worked on privacy tech like Tor, and I (Tanya) was on Cloudflare's cryptography team.\n\n We were unsatisfied with band-aid techniques like PII redaction (which is actually undesirable in some cases like AI personal assistants) or “pinky promise” security through legal contracts like DPAs. We wanted a real solution that replaced trust with provable security, and addressed our personal frustration with the false choice between exploring cutting-edge AI capabilities and personal privacy.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcicUJrVGkJrvHFqW2CaNEpGzvSfbjySaAR3k-Q8fbf56JtXg8xAJa5MJrYn-RIdJjFirmZ4khWay_UpV6WhnZKZEE9ApI5HX97jRKGw4mJOTblXrujRY_9xcCvGPL139p2QaKd1g?key=xi6EV3GMAYXvlmorGP948w)\n\n**The magic sauce**\n\nRunning models locally or on-prem is an option, but can be expensive and inconvenient. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is not practical for LLM inference for the foreseeable future. The next best option is using secure enclaves: a secure environment on the chip that no other software running on the host machine can access. This lets us perform LLM inference in the cloud while being able to prove that no one, not even Tinfoil or the cloud provider, can access the data. And because these security mechanisms are implemented in hardware, there is minimal performance overhead.\n\nUp until recently, secure enclaves were only available on CPUs. But NVIDIA confidential computing recently added these hardware-based capabilities to their latest GPUs, making it possible to run GPU-based workloads in a secure enclave.\n\nBelieve it when you see it, but Tinfoil has negligible performance overhead despite the strong security & privacy guarantees.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n**The best part is you can start using confidential AI chat and inference with Tinfoil today!**\n\n**Try our private chat: [tinfoil.sh/chat](http://tinfoil.sh/chat).**\n\n[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFszT0_vXk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFszT0_vXk)\n\n**Build with our API:** Drop-in replacement for the OpenAI chat-completions API with Tinfoil\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfBq_bx4bvZAzdB9BTzMg9KSE8UB2bKQO5uqfF5eoZkEWZFUtlbFnZpeD-m_PwaCVgUWftTt3QDLTW-r84u2dvUEGQ0ddbbQuq082ClI48l2cY4jWX-kWG1G6ZfwjNh8GN-EdAVJg?key=xi6EV3GMAYXvlmorGP948w)\n\nWe support several popular open source models like Deepseek R1 70B, Llama3.3 70B, Mistral 3.1 24B.

        "body": "# **TLDR**:\n\n# Jeevy Fabrication is a AI driven fabrication contractor for welded assemblies. We deliver higher quality QA and schedule transparency while maintaining competitive pricing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lB7YAlHF1U\n\n# **What we found**:\n\nIf you are building rockets to Mars or fusion systems, getting complex welded assemblies built to spec, on time, and on budget is mission-critical—**and incredibly hard**.\n\nOutsourcing to smaller weld shops can save money, but often at the cost of quality, schedule delays, and lost traceability. Precision assemblies often arrive dirty, out of spec, or late because these shops lack the project management horsepower needed to maintain the rigor high-stakes hardware demands.\n\n**Quick reality check:** Processing one drawing properly—with a detailed schedule, test plan, and QA flow—takes \\~9 hours. With only a 10% win rate on bids, a small shop could spend 90 hours just to land one job. That’s not scalable when you’ve got one or two engineers.\n\n# **Our approach**\n\nWe figured it would be awesome if we could offer the same high quality results of in-housing at the price of outsourcing a job. Our software reduces bid and scheduling time for our in-network shops **by over 80%**. It converts manufacturing drawings into an accurate bill of materials and a resource-loaded, high-fidelity schedule—eliminating costly errors and rework. Using these tools, our in-network fabricators can **spend less time bidding and deliver more reliable results than their competitors**. ‘\n\n**We handle the bids, purchase materials, and allocate jobs to shops in our network** that have the right capabilities and available capacity. By owning the job end-to-end, we ensure quality and adherence to key project milestones. In-network shops benefit from smarter scheduling tools and a steady stream of work to fill their downtime.\n\n# **About the Team**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90270&key=user_uploads/2560244/fd3594e1-0826-4e36-9631-04058ff16474)\n\nWe’re brothers—and that’s a desktop DAC (Direct Air Capture) we built together as a side project. We’ve always known we’d start a company together—it’s been part of the plan for as long as we can remember. And we’ve always said it had to be a rock ’n’ roll fueled adventure!\n\nOur dad was a serial entrepreneur, and dinner conversations were filled with stories and lessons from his ventures. That’s just how we grew up.\n\n**Jeevs**: Spent several years at SpaceX designing and building welded assemblies for launch pads in South Texas. The genesis of this idea came from the pain Jeevs experienced while sourcing parts for launch critical systems. “...why is there water in my cryogenic liquid oxygen pipe?? It’s like they’re trying to kill us!”\n\n**Vinay**: Several years of experience writing software for energy grid optimization projects. Worked at Rondo Energy designing and modeling grid scale heat batteries. He has a computer science and electrical degree from Princeton University.\n\n# **Our ask**\n\nNeed a welded part built? Know someone who does? Please let us know! ",

        "body": "Hey there 👋\n\nWe’re [James](https://x.com/J4mesBooth) and [Max](https://x.com/MaxB00th) - brothers and cofounders of [Chiron](https://projectchiron.org).\n\n# 📌 **TL;DR**\n\nChiron is an [iPad app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-chiron/id6502346822) that understands math as it’s written - like Grammarly for algebra. We’re both Oxford math grads, have tutored for a decade, and we’re creating the future of learning which will be entirely 1-on-1.\n\n[Launch Video](https://youtu.be/Ec8Nwe0EaSU)\n\n# ❌ **Problem**\n\nWith AI that’s so great at math, why can’t it teach at near-human quality?\n\n* Math is handwritten ✏️\n* Math has to be practiced not read 🧮\n* AI is rubbish at spotting _your_ mistakes 🔍\n\n# ✅ **Solution**\n\n* Freeform writing on a whiteboard app ✍️\n* Accuracy of a calculator with symbolic logic 🔢\n* Real-time feedback on every stroke (< 300ms) ⚡\n\n# ⚙️ **How we do it?**\n\nWith tens of thousands of lines of Python and Wolfram Language code. Writing on an iPad, we convert the stroke data to LaTeX, parse it, ask a million symbolic questions about it with reference to the problem’s _ground truth_ (the lines with a blue index), and assess whether it is right, wrong or something in between.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90706&key=user_uploads/1522067/b06893f5-bab0-4021-b09e-c8d38b33e4ee)\n\nWe do **not** rely on the vibes of a language model to assess the details of their working - too slow and unreliable. Many students give up on LLMs for genuine collaboration when they mislead them on topics the student finds difficult.\n\n**We can handle a lot of math already.**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90706&key=user_uploads/1522067/df464a12-f051-4c0a-8c03-90e660079c40)\n\n# **💡 Core insight**\n\nWe tried all the AI tutor desktop formulations we could imagine, but beyond the obvious interface challenge, AI is exceptionally poor at spotting the subtle mistakes students often make. LLMs are great at doing correct math, but much worse at pulling out an error within the many lines of messy student reasoning.\n\nWe started performing a symbolic analysis of the student’s working as context for the AI to boost accuracy - **but then we realised we could give this straight to the student.** This was when we started to feel the magic.\n\n# **🙏 Our Ask**\n\nSo far, _every_ single teacher we’ve demoed our iPad app to in person has immediately started work greenlighting a pilot. Let us know if you can introduce us to any math teachers teaching between Algebra I and Calculus I.\n\nAnd you can check out Chiron on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/project-chiron/id6502346822) now - or share with any students who might benefit from it!\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90706&key=user_uploads/1522067/7b18b9c0-1e00-49fa-a8bb-d6ab7bb7d080)\n\nCheers, James & Max",

Our agent lets anyone build AI-powered internal software using english. Connect your company’s apps & databases so ops, marketing, & finance can spin up dashboards, agentic workflows, & reports—fast. For developers, flip on “Dev Mode” and edit the code directly. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/AV8bvrh70k8\n\nInternal tooling is broken: ops, marketing, and finance teams need custom workflows & tools, but rely on engineers even for a prototype. Their requests die in backlogs & rarely see the light of day. Teams are left stitching data with basic spreadsheets, rigid SaaS tools, or with brittle no-code hacks. Software should be built by the people who use it. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/vBsabtMEpl0\n\n**Can we get a helping hand?**\n\nGot a painful workflow or employees complaining about tooling? Send us a message - we’re offering 30% off on the first 3 months of Odapt usage to any YC team.\n\n* Book a call: https://calendly.com/odapt/30min?month=2025-05\n* Email us: [founders@odapt.ai](mailto:founders@odapt.ai)\n* Check us out here: https://landing.odapt.ai/\n\n**Meet the team behind the otter**\n\nHeyo!

        "body": "Enterprise sales teams spend 50% of their time on research that misses the mark. Here's why — and how we're fixing it.\n\nHey everyone! We’re Saarth & Christopher – the founders of Sixtyfour. 👋\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nSixtyfour AI is the Bloomberg Terminal for sales. We work with hypergrowth companies to deploy custom research agents that map their Total Addressable Market and deliver real-time market signals, fully tailored to what matters most.\n\nCustomers like **Mercor**, **Traba**, **Hockeystack**, and **Conduit** use Sixtyfour to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/s45NR6diBPo\n\n**🧠** **The Enterprise GTM Problem**\n\nIf you’re selling into a niche or regulated market ( health systems, manufacturing, fintech, govtech, and so on), you already know: generic data platforms don’t work.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n**💡 “Intent signals” are too broad**\n\nMost tools will tell you someone visited a pricing page. That’s not useful when you’re selling a $250K solution into a regional hospital network or a logistics hub in the Midwest.\n\n**🧱 The nuance is everything**\n\nEnterprise sellers ask real questions:\n\nDid that manufacturing facility just expand its fleet?\n\nDoes it have two or three parking bays?\n\nDid that nursing home file a new Medicare cost report?\n\nIs the new VP of Ops a better entry point than the outgoing admin director?\n\nThese are the signals that drive pipeline and predict fit, and no off-the-shelf platform can give you that.\n\n**🔍 Static filters can’t model your ICP**\n\nTry finding “companies that just adopted Drift, expanded their marketing team by 30%, and hired a new CRO in the past 90 days” in traditional tools. Impossible. Our agents live in that world\n\n**✨ The Sixtyfour Advantage**\n\nWe don’t sell contact lists. We build intelligence infrastructure for your GTM engine.\n\n**📍 Custom TAMs, always current**\n\nWe work with your team to define and continuously update your market using real-world, dynamic data — regulatory filings, facility attributes, staff movements, and even track infrastructure like parking lot size.\n\n**📡 Proprietary real-time signals**\n\nFrom Medicare cost report changes to decision-maker exits to new vendor adoption — we detect what matters to your team, as it happens.\n\n**🧠 Deployable custom ML models**\n\nHave internal data on close rates, deal velocity, or expansion triggers? We plug it in.\n\nWe can train and deploy custom ML models to estimate buyer readiness, ICP fit, churn risk, and more, directly tailored to your pipeline data.\n\n**🤖 Agents that think like your best rep**\n\nOur AI agents mirror your go-to-market motion, tracking, qualifying, and notifying you at the exact right time.\n\n**👥The Team**\n\nWe’re both repeat founders who have built and sold into complex markets.\n\nSaarth is a UC Berkeley Data Science grad and ex-Whatnot (YC W20), Deepgram (YC W16), and Stanford researcher. He previously sold Internalize, built one of the first conversational AI agents (Dart), and has been building products since age 10.\n\nChristopher, a Cornell dropout, led GTM at Onyx (YC W24) and built sales AI tools at Symbl. He’s a CalHacks AI winner and ex-analyst at Cornell Atkinson, with deep experience across AI, ops, and consumer tech.\n\nWe’ve lived the pain of building GTM systems by hand, and we’re building the platform we always wished existed.\n\n**👋 Our Ask**\n\n🏢 Know a GTM, RevOps, or sales leader at an enterprise or hypergrowth vertical SaaS company? Send them to [sixtyfour.ai](http://sixtyfour.ai) — we’d love to chat.\n\n💬 Frustrated with generic signals and shallow filters? Let’s build something that works for your team.\n\nEvery intro, share, and shoutout means the world. Thank you — we’re just getting started.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90535&key=user_uploads/804300/0c80ad45-4d97-43f6-8fed-9a5782416b19)\n\n",

Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\r\n\r\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",

        "body": "# **TL;DR**\n\nOpusense turns field notes, voice memos, and photos into fully formatted inspection reports **automatically**. Used by engineers and inspectors in construction, infrastructure, and consulting to save time each day, reduce errors, and keep branding consistent. It’s like having a reporting assistant in your pocket!\n\n📌 Interested in using Opusense at your firm? Book a demo: [cal.com/royac](http://cal.com/royac)\n\n🎥 Launch video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV26sN5Buls\n\n# **❌ The Problem**\n\nMost field teams still rely on writing notes by hand and typing them into Word templates hours or even days after leaving the site. It’s slow, error-prone, and easy to fall behind. For firms managing dozens of active sites, the reporting backlog is the most painful part of the job. No engineer enjoys writing the same reports over and over. It’s an overlooked market, but consultants are on every construction site, and inspections in the US alone make up a $30B industry.\n\n# **✅ Our Solution**\n\n**Opusense is your AI-powered reporting assistant.**\n\n📱 On-site just open our mobile app and speak or type notes, and snap photos\n\n🧠 Our AI turns raw inputs into structured reports tailored to your firm’s format and style\n\n📄 Instantly export as Word or PDF — zero formatting needed\n\nIt works offline on any phone or tablet  — no laptop, no end-of-day chaos.\n\n_Field oversight for managers back at the office? Don’t worry_ —  _we’ve got a solution for that!_\n\nOur users also have access to a web interface which shows real-time reports as they are generated.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90178&key=user_uploads/1672839/9dcabf16-bcf2-44f0-b457-eb31559ce72d)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90178&key=user_uploads/1672839/dea94169-a70b-4bf9-98dc-2a0d63210a2e)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90178&key=user_uploads/1672839/3b3b5009-bbe4-46bf-829d-80f44f8d83c3)\n\n# **💼 Who It’s For**\n\n* Engineering consultants (third-party consulting firms)\n  * Across all field departments (BQA, Structural, Environmental, Geotechnical, etc.)\n* Site inspectors\n\nWe’re already live with multiple firms across North America including multinational corporations.\n\n# **🛠 The Backstory**\n\nOur CEO Roya has a PhD in Civil Engineering from the University of Waterloo and a MSc in Advanced Infrastructure Systems from Carnegie Mellon. She previously worked as a site inspector at engineering consulting firms, where the firsthand frustration of field reporting inspired Opusense. Our CTO Michael has a background in ECE from the University of Waterloo. He focused on building AI systems in the fields of robotics and self-driving cars and previously worked in startups in the construction industry, giving him insight into what users need in this field. We created Opusense because reporting was the worst part of the job, so we decided to get rid of it. \n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90178&key=user_uploads/1672839/70a68664-803c-439d-a73a-1d54936691f8)\n\n# **Let’s Chat**\n\nKnow someone who deals with field reporting chaos?\n\nWant to try Opusense yourself?\n\n✉️ Shoot me an Email: [rcody@opusense.com](mailto:rcody@opusense.com)\n\n🌐 Learn more: [opusense.com](http://opusense.com)",

        "body": "Hello world 🏄 we are [Hemang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemangkandwal/) and [Anguel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahristozov/) from [Clidey](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clidey/), and we are building [Docucod](https://docucod.com/)!\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**Docucod automatically generates and maintains complete, always-up-to-date documentation—straight from your codebase.**\n\nDemo video: https://youtu.be/SAaZq9UHAic\n\n# **❗** What is the problem?\n\nOn average, developers spend **20–30% of their time** maintaining documentation—and that doesn’t even include the time it takes to create it in the first place. That’s nearly **12 hours in a standard 40-hour week**, often more if you're part of a fast-growing team.\n\nMost tools are still manual and time-consuming, stealing hours better spent building, selling, or scaling.\n\nGreat documentation isn’t just helpful—it’s a **growth engine**. Look at Stripe: their docs earn trust and convert users.\n\nThe truth? At most companies, documentation is an afterthought (we haven’t written ours yet either!) And we get it—“documentation specialist” usually isn’t on anyone’s job title.\n\n# 💡 What is the solution?\n\n**Docucod auto-generates and maintains always-up-to-date documentation—straight from your codebase.** You continue building, we’ll focus on the documentation.\n\nIt fits effortlessly into your workflow, whether you’re a small team or managing complex repos.\n\nFrom onboarding guides to API references and system diagrams, Docucod delivers clear, comprehensive docs with zero manual work.\n\nFully editable and always in sync, it lets you ship fast **and** document well—without compromise.\n\n# 🧠 How it works:\n\n* Connect your GitHub account and select a repo.\n* Docucod scans your repo to understand its structure and functionality, building an intelligent knowledge graph that maps out components, features, code flow, and so on.\n* It creates a structured documentation plan, outlining sections, navigation, and individual pages.\n* Docucod generates rich content with diagrams and contextual clarity.\n* Finally, it automatically pushes the documentation back to your repo for deployment.\n\n# 😎 Want to see some real examples?\n\nhttps://github.com/clidey/whodb-docs - deployed at http://whodb-docs.docucod.com/\n\nhttps://github.com/clidey/todos-docs - deployed at https://todo-docs.docucod.com/\n\n# 💯 Who Are We and Why Did We Build This?\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90620&key=user_uploads/1558575/1eddcff2-4b1a-4343-847d-eb35680c9693)\n\nWe’re Hemang and Anguel—friends, builders, and longtime hackathon teammates. After years working at places like Palantir, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley, we saw one issue everywhere: documentation gets rushed, postponed, or skipped—and the fallout is always the same.\n\nWe built Docucod because this isn’t a people problem—it’s a systems problem. The fix isn’t better habits. It’s automation.\n\n> **We’re here to make documentation sexy again.**\n\n# 🤔 Is Docucod right for you?\n\n**Don’t use Docucod if:**\n\n🚫 You enjoy rewriting GitHub auth instructions.\n\n🚫 You love writing and maintaining docs by hand.\n\n**Use Docucod if:**\n\n✅ You want docs that stay up to date—automatically.\n\n✅ You want new hires productive on Day 1.\n\n✅ You’d rather ship than document.\n\n# 🥹 Our ask:\n\nIf this resonates with you, **get in touch:**\n\n[hemang.kandwal@clidey.com](mailto:hemang.kandwal@clidey.com), [anguel.hristozov@clidey.com](mailto:anguel.hristozov@clidey.com), or\n\nhttps://calendly.com/clidey/conversation-with-clidey-15-min - if there’s a time that you’d like to speak but it shows as unavailable, please just message us!\n\nIf you owned documentation or know someone who owns it now, we would love to get a warm introduction.\n\nLet’s make documentation an asset—not a chore.\n\nThat’s our fish! 👇\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90620&key=user_uploads/1558575/afe2507e-ada5-46a5-b9f8-93eb3ab48a36)\n\n",

        "body": "The purpose of software is fundamentally changing, from platforms that track your work, to agents that complete work on your behalf. We’re building [Kaizen](https://www.kaizenautomation.com/), the platform for building software that does work on the web.\\\n\\\nHey y’all! We’re [Ken](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-acquah-45b397123/) & [Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-silver-853952129/) — the founders of Kaizen!\n\n**📚 TL;DR**\n\nWith Kaizen, developers can integrate with any web application **in minutes, instead of weeks**. **Leading AI companies** use Kaizen to read and write from legacy portals in **logistics**, **healthcare**, and **financial services**.\n\n[Launch Video](https://youtu.be/flw30r5vWyk)\n\n### 🔗 **The Integration Problem**\n\nIn most industries, **the biggest bottleneck to automation is integration**. In these sectors, operators will interface with hundreds of web applications: between systems of records, customer portals, and proprietary internal software. **Building integrations across all these systems was previously impossible, leaving much of the economy mired in repetitive, manual workflows.**\n\nFor software vendors in these industries, this pain is most acute. Long integration times **stall customer onboarding, halt product velocity, and strictly bound the value they can provide to customers**. Startups are forced to choose between severe limits to feature capabilities and staffing large internal “integration” teams.\n\nAs AI agents rapidly scale, **this problem only gets worse**. Tools like voice agents, AI scribes, or procurement copilots are ready to work _on behalf_ of users but are stopped in their tracks by authenticated websites without UIs.\n\n### **🥁Introducing: Kaizen**\n\n**💻 How does it work?**\\\nWithin [Kaizen](https://www.kaizenautomation.com/), developers construct a set of “blocks” describing your automation. We leverage computer use models to create deterministic automations for any website.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf7WyATvregN5i_3XfB-drcta62yQeAn6vSWWJFjJAxwd63FfPN31VNK7TgUfE_mopwAAPx88yzyvzLBeo7T_kn0vSdFb1RS1UFiYi_0KGDekc8sz0OWS1ZvQwtBh8-PoIXRymocA?key=_Ybxg5buJr7nan_b4Td9Og)\n\nKaizen exposes a powerful [API](https://docs.kaizenautomation.com/api-reference/workflows/execute-a-workflow), developers can use to programmatically trigger automations. With Kaizen, your application can automatically complete forms, retrieve critical business data, and execute end-to-end processes on behalf of your users.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfCeKs_JBambiElHCLRdIe5484RmX7rSfb1epyQBw-104cm3oWotpzWofcQvJrqx_CfBglkynZmrphexWRcg2zPdOlB2hA5Oe0I1mbN1or9fjAx6sY7nptmsCbiM5OcQplJGwE-9Q?key=_Ybxg5buJr7nan_b4Td9Og)\n\n**🕵️ Who’s it for?**\\\nKaizen helps engineering teams in traditional industries (logistics, financial services, healthcare, insurance) accelerate their integration roadmap. Use cases we enable include:\n\n* Logistics agents that automatically bid across hundreds of shipper boards.\n* RCM automation software that dynamically completes forms for hundreds of payer portals.\n* Tech-enabled lenders that leverage data from thousands of municipal, county, and state government websites.\n* and many, many, more…\n\n**🤔 Why Kaizen?**\n\n2025 will be the year of browser agents, and Kaizen is the best platform for you to launch your own.\n\n* **Reliable, fast workflows:** Customers come to us after trying computer use agents that can’t reliably log in to a legacy portal. Kaizen caches each action it takes to ensure workflows run fast and reliably.\n* **We handle the plumbing:** Kaizen automatically handles browser session management, 2FA authentication, and anti-bot measures. To launch your first workflow, you simply need to describe it in English.\n* **For developers, by developers:** Most solutions in this space are rigid and brittle, making it hard for developers to fully own their automations. Kaizen is [API-first](https://docs.kaizenautomation.com/api-reference/workflows/execute-a-workflow) and supports arbitrary code snippets, giving product builders maximum flexibility.\n\n### 👥 **The Team**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90644&key=user_uploads/539074/ea8aec2e-463b-4cc7-a1af-464f5a9a519a)\n\nWe met six years ago at MIT, hacking on zero-knowledge proofs and image generation algorithms. Since then, Ken’s led automation teams in the freight industry, building LLM-powered browser workflows across a maze of portals. Michael spent six years at MIT CSAIL researching web-scale information retrieval, then developed deep infrastructure expertise at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) and [Gather](https://www.gather.town/).\n\nWe’ve lived through the pain of manually stitching together web automations—and we’re building Kaizen to ensure no engineering team experiences that again.\n\n### 🙏🏼 **Our Ask**\n\nWe’re looking to onboard more engineering teams across **financial services**, **healthcare**, and **logistics** and would really appreciate your help. If you or someone you know is struggling to automate work on websites without APIs, send them to [kaizenautomation.com](http://kaizenautomation.com).",

        "body": "🎟️ **TL;DR**\\\n**Selling tickets sucks…** We’re building Ticket Wallet - an **AI-powered resale platform** **for ticket brokers.** We automate pricing, listing, and distribution across all major marketplaces. \n\nWe do everything you just press sell.\\\n\\\n(**P.S.** If you have season tickets and need help selling, message us!)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Z4VG8kJJ4](https://youtu.be/a_Z4VG8kJJ4)\n\n🌐 **The Origin Story**\\\nRyan and I (Truman) met on the Princeton Men’s Soccer team and have been best friends for nearly 8 years. He studied computer science with a focus on AI/ML, and I studied econ. Ryan could build, I could sell - we just needed something to work on.\n\nWe finally got the chance our senior year when we tried selling our own season tickets.\n\nIt was terrible. The process was manual, time-consuming, and completely outdated. That pain quickly turned into an obsession. \n\n💥 **The Problem We’re Solving**\\\nIt's really difficult to sell tickets, especially if you have a lot of them. Brokers are the **power sellers** of the industry, often moving **$10M+** in ticket volume annually. Yet they are stuck using spreadsheets, updating prices manually, and listing tickets on one site at a time. You can think of it like day trading on the stock market 10+ years ago. Even crazier, the biggest brokers are hiring pricing teams in the Philippines…\n\nIt’s 2025. We have self-driving cars but ticket sellers are still updating rows in Excel and refreshing StubHub?\n\n🔨 **What We’re Building**\\\nTicket Wallet is the first **AI-powered selling system for ticket brokers.** We price, list, and manage their tickets across all the major marketplaces (Ticketmaster, StubHub, SeatGeek, Vivid Seats, Gametime, Tickpick, AXS, etc...) Sellers **just press “list”** and we handle the rest.\n\nSince launching, we’ve onboarded over **$3M in ticket inventory**, **100+ paying sellers**, and we’re **starting to work with pro sports teams**. We charge 10% of every ticket sold.\n\nTicket brokers using Ticket Wallet have seen a **27% increase in revenue**  per ticket sold. We run their entire business \n\nThe market for ticket brokers in the US is **$26.3B.**\n\n**🔑 Key Features:**\n\n* AI pricing that updates 24/7\n* Listings pushed everywhere automatically \n* Central dashboard to manage inventory \n* Analytics to track progress and sales\n* Zero manual work\n* Website and mobile application\n\nIt’s like giving sellers superpowers - or at least their weekends back.\n\n**🧿 What We’re Looking For:**\n\n* Feedback from anyone selling tickets (or trying to!)\n* Warm intros to pro teams, ticket brokers, or season ticket holders\n* YC Alum with sports/entertainment connections or partnerships we should explore\n* Download our mobile app on iOS (Ticket Wallet):\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/ticket-wallet/id6463562809\n\n**🔋 Other Marketplaces Cost Money. We Make You More.**\n\nTruman & Ryan\\\n(Ticket Wallet, YC X25)",

        "body": "Hi! We’re Derik and Andrew, and we’re building RunRL: the platform that lets you run reinforcement learning on your AI.\n\nWe used to run an AI research lab together, and Andrew dropped out from his RL PhD to provide you the greatest reinforcement learning experience possible.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPP5YNMA4GE\n\n# The problem\n\nFor a generic LLM agent, every day is like the first day on the job. Tools and tasks need exhaustive explanations. Even still, agents are too unreliable for deployment.\n\n# Our fix\n\nRL fine-tuning produces specialist models that intuitively know what to do. It uses the algorithms that produced DeepSeek R1, but customized for your use case.\n\nSimply give us a reward function that tells us what’s good and what’s bad—and we’ll make your model improve.\n\n### Example 1: chemistry\n\nYou’re trying to make a model that generates potential drug candidates for COVID. You want them to bind as tightly to the active site of Sars-CoV-2 protease as possible, but using Claude+thinking+web-search only gets you a binding performance of 22. Making a better model is as simple as defining the reward to be the binding performance of the model’s outputs:\n\n```\ndef reward(output):\n    molecule = parse_SMILES(output)\n\n    if valid_molecule(output):\n    return binding_performance(output)\nelse:\n    return -1\n```\n\nloading it up on [RunRL.com](http://RunRL.com), and hitting run:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdybuN1eu2Y3fSZi4m9Wc9YR4a-YYACWTt_jxx611-UVsNZ_G-UriMLuSW0JDalz65ixrgYYEIQcc8p1ni8bz2RpLp1HZcX0YIfTVfa1mE-TqFNL787gI94VNHHfcIy4mVoFxlqKQ?key=Wlf0KwcYIPK-rxwiB_U0-Q)\n\nSo, a model 175x smaller than Claude learns to outperform the frontier models!\n\n### Example 2: agents\n\nYou have an OpenAI or Anthropic-based agent, but it’s not as reliable as you’d like it to be. Maybe your agent already does what you want most of the time, but isn’t consistent enough to be trusted in production. RL can help with that too: it reinforces good behavior and makes your agent better at rule-following, information extraction, and document navigation in high-stakes environments. Join our beta [here](https://www.runrl.com/products/agentflow/)!\n\n# Run RL!\n\nIf you’re using AI and you want your model to be better, and you have a way of describing what “better” is: you’re ready to [run RL](https://runrl.com).\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90475&key=user_uploads/1161067/2e061652-2c07-473b-a95d-8fb07cdc36cd)\n\n",

        "body": "Hey YC! 👋 We’re Adi and Arnav, co-founders of Morphik (https://morphik.ai).\n\n### **TL;DR**\n\n* **Problem:** Knowledge workers spend a lot of their time searching complex documentation with diagrams, tables, or spreadsheets, just to find relevant information. Text‑only RAG misses details, hallucinates, and provides half-baked responses.\n* **Solution:** Morphik embeds whole pages (image + text, no OCR), auto‑builds a knowledge graph, and serves it through a UI, SDK, or REST API. We have 90 % accuracy on arXiv QA (and we can fine-tune for your use case 🙂).\n\nWatch our demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3adZQhm5JZY\n\n### **Problem**\n\nRAG breaks the moment documents stop being blobs of text.\n\n* Knowledge workers spend a lot of their time (people we spoke with said 50-70% time just in the research phase). eg. electrical engineers finding perfect PCB spec, pharma companies trying to search ELNs for similar experiments.\n* 80% of enterprise knowledge lives in diagrams, tables, images, CAD, scanned pdfs, not .txt.\n* “Multimodal” models still hallucinate or miss key context because the retrieval step sees only text, or they rely on tools to retrieve diagrams, or context. (https://docs.morphik.ai/blogs/gpt-vs-morphik-multimodal)\n* Teams glue together OCR, vector DBs, and regex‑heavy ETL that becomes a brittle monstrosity.\n\n### **Solution**\n\nDirectly embedding and search over page images\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdzvQJeEBmnvZI1Mkl2ZYCtsN0AG4Mx5JpcN4RtivMfndGshgTkj1uZcb8BkFAkXXNCpg9TPqeIKsqCXscaLzGDNO2e8TFn8naJPkJ_XtceDHlwNrAAcV69QGYlzSOwvdofI7FksQ?key=wmYsqYRKzN1ploJFaFpgwCeu)\n\nWhen you ingest in Morphik, in addition to OCR, we create direct embeddings for the image of a page (or frames in a video). When you ask “Colpali comparison to standard RAG”, the LLM sees the actual page image, so multimodal models can reason over arrows, labels, scales, and colours just like a human.\n\n### **Rules Engine**\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcOXXa3wTpZV26zi8kaucVOt2QuUgKKfrdvlyqlFfeHmDUudWpNaS-r6KNm5--4Joz4rE5tsiu_NDqlHnRE914l7ad4YtKRRLc_X1gm7BteBR0aMN446aia7LGA1l7b2UJMor97?key=wmYsqYRKzN1ploJFaFpgwCeu)\n\nWhen ingesting, you can define rules for data extraction (which would again consider tables, diagrams), or define natural language rules for PII redaction, or content transformation.\n\n### **Deployment ready, scalable**\n\nMorphik comes built in with folder scoping, end user scoping, GPU accelerations, and fine grained permissions, so you can prototype and deploy with enterprise grade features. It’s end‑to‑end, so you don’t scramble to make duct tape fixes.\n\n### **One more thing…Morphik Research Agent**\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcL9LvkrH861vRDhuFlYlBy0LsjlhMOYVBLRLdnj903G5L3QMgx12ziGZJhO_h2SzAakjD27e0Yeu4XZwmsE4Yv1BGNRj-OGc41i798xy_UW9MVHISzJy0GBrTsOWWqWBGdtGKhmg?key=wmYsqYRKzN1ploJFaFpgwCeu)\n\nOur research agent uses Morphik’s retrieval, graph, and extraction APIs as tools. It chains them automatically, jumping from doc to doc, node to node, seeing figures, till it finds the needle in the haystack, or has enough context to answer your questions. “Describe the third pin on the USBC21 diagram” will get the diagram, find the pin, jump to the table with pin descriptions, jump to page 13 to “find more details on page 13”.\n\n### **Why we might be interesting to you**\n\n* Building an internal ChatGPT over messy manuals? Morphik is the fastest way to ship something users _trust_.\n* Developing an AI product? Swap your vector‑DB‑plus‑duct‑tape stack for a single SDK call.\n* Researching graph‑RAG? CAG? We have it all.\n\n### **Our Ask 🙏**\n\n1. **⭐ Star / watch** https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core – open source momentum matters.\n2. **Introductions** to teams drowning in technical docs (healthcare, manufacturing, legal, electrical engineers).\n3. Tell us **what still hurts in your RAG stack**, comment, **DM, or email** [founders@morphik.ai](mailto:founders@morphik.ai) or [book a call](https://cal.com/adityavardhan-agrawal-x6jyhq/30min).\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nAdi & Arnav",

        "body": "Hi everyone - we’re Rene and Ian, ex-AWS AI & Security, and we’re thrilled to introduce [Casco](https://casco.com)! Casco prevents AI agents and apps from messing up by evaluating them for security, safety, and accuracy.\n\nCasco already secures AI systems deployed in 60% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SWPnB-GADdE\n\n**The Problem** \n\nCompanies building AI agents and apps face a disproportionate amount of cybersecurity threats that put their business at risk. 73% of enterprises experienced at least one AI-related security incident (that they know of) in the past 12 months, with the average incident cost amounting to $4.8m. It takes 40% longer for companies to identify and address these AI-related incidents.\n\nExisting solutions do not work for these companies:\n\n1. Automated scans yield low-quality, noisy security findings.\n2. Thorough security evaluations are cost-prohibitive to most companies.\n3. New AI attack vectors are emerging faster than companies can adapt.\n\n**Our Solution: Casco’s supervised, agentic red-teaming**\n\nCasco proactively uncovers critical vulnerabilities before attackers do. Here’s how:\n\n1. **Sophisticated, AI-Driven Attack Simulation:** Casco uses advanced techniques, just like an expert human red teamer, to devise and execute multi-step attacks against your AI agents and apps.\n2. **Human-Validated Expertise:** The AI evaluations are supervised and validated by our team, ensuring high-fidelity findings. We’ve built and secured AI systems, applications, and cloud infrastructure at AWS, Microsoft, and the US government.\n3. **Actionable, Compliance-Ready Reports:** Casco provides comprehensive reports with reproduction steps, risk explanations, and remediation guidance, aiding compliance with SOC 2, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, and ISO 27001.\n\n**Our Story**\n\nAs founding members of the Generative AI team at AWS (Lead Engineer + Security, Head of Product), we witnessed the evolving landscape of AI agents and applications. We identified emerging security gaps as traditional security practices struggled to keep pace with this new paradigm.\n\nRecognizing the critical need to secure AI systems, we decided to build Casco. Our mission is to empower builders to innovate confidently, knowing their AI systems are secure.\n\n**Secure your AI agent and apps**\n\nIs your AI agent or app secure?\n\n* [**Book a Demo**](https://calendar.app.google/LZybyH27Pd4ScXPk6) to secure your AI systems",

        "body": "Hey YC [👋](https://emojipedia.org/waving-hand)\n\nWe’re [Max B](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximeberthelot/), [Baptiste](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdebever/), and [Max G](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxguerois/) - co-founders of [Lucis](https://www.lucis.life/).\n\n### **TL;DR**\n\n**Lucis turns regular blood tests into actionable health insights - so people can act before it’s too late.** In 4 months, we’ve helped 500 people in Paris get ahead of chronic diseases. Today, we’re expanding across Europe.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/a5fX1K5hnvU\n\n### **The Problem In Europe**\n\n85% of deaths are caused by preventable chronic diseases. That’s more than 4 million lives lost every year just in Europe. Yet, the healthcare system remains reactive, and people receive care only after something goes wrong.\n\nThose seeking comprehensive preventive care, including blood testing, analysis, and expert guidance, typically resort to private longevity clinics that charge over €50K per year. **Such premium healthcare remains inaccessible to the vast majority of people.**\n\n### **Lucis: Health Insights in Your Pocket**\n\n_“If you're tired of being in the dark about your health, not knowing where you stand or what to do next, Lucis is built for you.”_\n\nLucis goes beyond vague checkups and unreadable lab reports. It provides a clear health baseline, tracks progress over time, and translates complex biomarker data into personalized guidance people can actually implement in their daily lives. All at a fraction of the cost of a private clinic.\n\nYou’ll get answers to questions like:\n\n_\"Am I aging faster than I should?\"_\n\n_\"Is my testosterone at a healthy level for my age?\"_\n\n_\"How can I improve my next marathon performance?\"_\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90454&key=user_uploads/1454634/0a347d82-7c9b-4fef-8c72-bf70511ce761)\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n* 2 full health check-ups per year\n* See how your body’s doing with 15 health scores and your biological age - and track your progress over time.\n* Personalized action plan across nutrition, sleep, and movement\n* Access to longevity add-on tests, like microbiome, continuous glucose monitoring, and food sensitivity tests.\n\n### **The Team**\n\nWe started Lucis because we’ve lived the problem ourselves.\n\nBaptiste lost a close relative to a condition that could’ve been caught earlier. Max B has spent the last decade deep in biohacking, testing everything from supplements to wearables. At 27, Max G turned his health into an experiment - tracking sleep, diet, and training - and improved nearly all of his biomarkers in the process. We know what it’s like to search for clarity and get none.\n\n**Lucis is what we wish we had - and now, we’re building it for everyone else.**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90454&key=user_uploads/1454634/830d7470-4a85-446e-b427-38ec7343d441)\n\n### **Since launching our beta just 4 months ago:**\n\n* **30,000+ people** have joined our European longevity community.\n* **30+ lab locations** opened across France\n* **2 new European cities** - now live in Lisbon 🇵🇹 and London 🇬🇧\n* **500+ people in Paris** used Lucis to get ahead of chronic illness\n* **10 AI Startups** have gifted Lucis as a health benefit for their employees\n\n## \n\n### **Our Vision**\n\n**Lucis isn’t just a product - we’re building a completely new healthcare system in Europe.** One that lives with you. And works for you quietly, every day.\n\nWe started with blood, but our ambition goes far beyond a single input. We are building Lucis, the intelligence layer for your health. Right in your pocket.\n\n### **Ask**\n\nIf this resonates with you\n\n* Know someone in Europe who wants to live 100 healthy years?

        "body": "Hey everyone 👋 — we’re **Bergen**, **Pablo**, and **Arnau**, and we’re building **throxy**.\n\nHiring SDRs is expensive. Managing tools is a full-time job. Agencies spam your market and burn trust.\n\nWe started throxy in 2023 because we lived the chaos, and knew there had to be a better way.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q1Ud9V5GP8>\n\n### ❌ The Problem\n\n* Building an SDR team takes months, and burns $150K+ before you see results.\n* Tool stacks (Clay, Instantly, Apollo, etc.) require constant management and constantly break.\n* Most agencies rely on automation and generic messaging that _kills trust_.\n\nCompanies selling into legacy industries suffer most, where reaching the right decision-makers requires **trust, precision, and care**.\n\nIf you’ve sold into sectors like manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, or finance, you’ve felt it: **complex buyers, long sales cycles, and real consequences.**\n\nSpray-and-pray doesn’t work here.\n\n**We win where others fail — in industries where trust isn’t optional, and precision means pipeline.**\n\n### ✅ Why Throxy Wins\n\nWhere most AI sales tools generalise, **we specialise**.\n\nWe design, build, and run **fully-managed outbound systems, so you don’t have to** — combining AI-powered execution with human-level strategy.\n\nYou tell us your ICP and how many meetings you want. We handle the rest.\n\n* 🔍 **AI-powered research** to find real decision-makers — not just job titles\n* ✍️ **Hand-written** **messaging** with your buyer’s language — not templates\n* 🛠 **Deliverability stack**: domains, warmup, inboxes — all done for you\n* 🧠 **Human-led strategy** from operators who’ve sold in these sectors\n* 📅 **Qualified meetings**, delivered to your calendar — no tools, no SDRs, no micromanagement\n\nWe’re already generating **six figures in pipeline** for B2B companies selling into hard-to-crack industries like manufacturing, logistics, finance and healthcare. Built for founders, CEOs, CROs, and sales teams.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90134&key=user_uploads/1293483/4da51dcd-3789-4946-af08-86ccf54ca594)\n\n### 💡 Why We're Building This\n\nWe believe outbound should be **automated, intelligent, and deeply humanised,** not a messy stack of disconnected tools and guesswork.\n\nSales teams should focus on building relationships and closing deals, not juggling tools, bloated teams or manual workflows.\n\n**throxy’s vision is a world where outbound is fully automated yet precisely human, freeing up human capital to think, connect, and close.**\n\n### 👋 Meet the Founders\n\n* **Bergen** built his first online business at 14 and brings operational execution at scale\n* **Pablo** ran enterprise sales from Seed to Series D, and knows how to break into tough markets\n* **Arnau** led early GPT-2 and BERT systems at JP Morgan and drives AI & product\n\n### 👇 Want to see what “done-for-you” outbound _actually_ looks like?\n\nWe’re live. We’re booking meetings.\n\nAnd we’re looking to partner with more companies targeting traditional industries.\n\nIf you're scaling outbound and are not getting results, let us run your outbound, so you can run your business.\n\n📬 [founders@throxy.com](mailto:founders@throxy.com) | 🌐 [throxy.com](https://throxy.com/?utm_source=ycombinator&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=yc_launch&utm_id=yc_launch)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90134&key=user_uploads/1293483/b5efeb76-2c0b-48ef-91c4-eeb1b4939e5f)\n\n",

The next industrial revolution is here, and we’re building the platform to power it.\r\n\r\nModern buyers want less talk, faster decisions, and seamless experiences. Lyra helps sales teams close more deals, shorten sales cycles, and operate more efficiently — all with minimal rep involvement.\r\n\r\nWe built our own meeting software from the ground up with a real-time AI agent at its core:\r\n- Surfaces and personalizes relevant sales collateral using live conversation intelligence\r\n- Keeps deals moving by answering buyer questions when reps are offline\r\n- Replaces decks, screen shares, and long email threads with a single interactive workspace — called a Lyra. It hosts your meetings, onboarding, and integrates tools like DocuSign to give buyers a seamless path from first call to signed contract\r\n\r\nHundreds of sales calls are already hosted on Lyra, including several YC companies. We hit $100K ARR in our first two weeks.\r\n\r\nWe’re rethinking the sales stack from first call to signed contract.",

        "body": "### **TL;DR**\n\nTheta is building self-learning and real-time adaptation for AI agents.\n\nWe’re starting with an intelligent memory layer so agents can remember and learn from previous interactions. With a simple four-line addition to your existing code, our memory layer uses real-time learning to analyze every run for mistakes and optimizations. The relevant insights are then passed on to your agent during future runs. \n\nWe’ve already improved the accuracy of OpenAI Operator by 43% with 7x fewer steps taken. If you’re building AI agents where reliability and speed are priorities, book a meeting [here](https://calendly.com/d/cndj-84h-9qz) or contact us at [founders@thetasoftware.ai](mailto:founders@thetasoftware.ai).\n\n\\\nhttps://youtu.be/TRNWfhyUI4E\n\n### **The Current Approach**\n\nAgents struggle to adapt to complex, real-world workflows. Workflows are dynamic, but agents remain static.\n\n* They get stuck in loops, repeating mistakes and requiring constant human guidance in the right direction. Your prompts get longer and longer as you try to hard-code solutions.\n* Even when your agent successfully completes a task, this long process starts all over again for any future run. Starting a new Cursor chat or Operator session means losing all of the insights and “aha moments” your agent had.\n\nLearning is fundamentally iterative, but agents can’t learn because they have no memory across runs.\n\n### **How Theta Works**\n\nTheta is building the infrastructure for agents to self-learn and adapt in real-time. The first component is an intelligent memory layer that learns from your agent’s previous runs. Just add four lines of code to your agent stack to get started:\n\n* At the end of the current run, Theta generates and embeds an analysis of your agent’s trajectory. It identifies critical steps and assesses overall performance.\n* Before the next run, Theta generates a detailed plan based on the specified task. It gathers relevant insights and optimizations based on previous runs.\n* With real-time learning, the memory layer continues to improve with more runs—meaning your agent gets better and better with zero human intervention.\n\nUsing this memory layer, we were able to improve the accuracy of OpenAI Operator by 43%. With optimized trajectories, Operator also took 7x fewer steps, resulting in better speed and cost.\n\n### **Our Ask**\n\nIf you’re building agents that need to perform dynamic, real-world workflows at the highest accuracy and speed, reach out to [founders@thetasoftware.ai](mailto:founders@thetasoftware.ai) or book some time [here.](https://calendly.com/d/cndj-84h-9qz)\n\n### **Our Team**\n\nRayan has previously done ML research as Head of Product at DeepSilicon. He’s been childhood friends with Tanmay since third grade, who previously built an AI browser and developed browser agents at MultiOn. During Rayan’s freshman year of college, he met Gurvir, who built distributed ML systems at Cornell, focusing on post-training and RL.",

        "body": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nWe’re **Georges and Mathieu — co-founders of Novoflow**.\n\n### **TL;DR**\n\nNovoflow’s multilingual voice agent answers every inbound & outbound call, schedules directly inside any EHR (Epic, Athena, Medent—even 1990s HL7 feeds), and slashes no-shows. Clinics can reclaim **up to $50k/month** on average in missed revenue without hiring another receptionist.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LQA-QeiY_F4\n\n### **❌ The Problem**\n\nThe old reception model is breaking. Outsourced call centers, dead-end IVRs, and half-integrated schedulers still miss 42% of patient calls. Each unbooked physician hour stacks into a $50,000 monthly loss in revenue per average independent clinic. Medical practices are stuck because decade-old and proprietary EHRs can’t accept real-time integrations from next-gen solutions.\n\n### **🏥 Our Solution**\n\n**Full-stack AI receptionist**\n\n1. **24 / 7 voice AI** greets patients in 25+ languages, verifies insurance, and classifies intent in real-time.\n2. **Universal EHR plumbing** writes, reschedules, or cancels appointments natively inside any system.\n3. **One-hour go-live**: point our SIP trunk at the clinic’s number—no new phones, no code.\n4. **Dashboard & KPIs**: abandonment, call-to-appointment conversion, provider utilization, no-show rate.\n\nEarly adopters project a **10% jump in provider utilization** and a **22% lift in call-to-appointment conversion**—with happier patients to match.\n\n### **🙏 Our Ask**\n\n* Know an independent clinic, multi-specialty group, or surgery center bleeding revenue to missed calls?\n* Have friends or family running front-desk operations that need multilingual coverage?\n* Want to beta-test features like outbound recall automation or balance-due collection?\n\n👉 Intro us! We’re only onboarding **3 more clinics this month**.\n\n[mathieu@novoflow.io](mailto:mathieu@novoflow.io) | [georges@novoflow.io](mailto:georges@novoflow.io)\n\n### **Why We’re Building This**\n\nWe spent two years as French & Spanish medical interpreters. Receptionists called us after hours because patients couldn’t communicate, and clinics lost money while care was delayed. We realized **voice AI + universal EHR integration** could fix the bottleneck for the 100k+ clinics still trapped by legacy software.\n\n### **👬 The Team**\n\n* **Georges** – CMU engineer and in the voice AI agent space for 5+ years.\n* **Mathieu** – Emory University Scholar, ex-medical interpreter, been in the healthcare space for 2+ years\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90451&key=user_uploads/1763646/7ced6963-dce3-4c84-8854-0c11fbe5cf2f)\n\nWe fly on-site, launch the same week, and target **$40k+ monthly savings** per clinic.\n\nThanks for reading — tear apart our approach, ask tough questions, or just say hi!",

        "body": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nWe're [Alex](https://x.com/spicy_liu), [Land](https://x.com/LTantichot), and [Rajit](https://x.com/RajitWrites) - co-founders of [Prism](https://x.com/teamprismai).\n\n# **TL;DR:**\n\nPrism is an AI that watches session replays and tells developers what to fix.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xmvlRom8BNA\n\n# **Problem**\n\nAt Rajit’s previous company, they built a new onboarding flow, set up a dashboard to analyze it, and realized that it was broken. The problem was that this realization came four months later.\n\nThis is the core insight that led us to start Prism.\n\nExisting product analytics solutions are inflexible. They require comprehensive instrumentation and break every time an engineer adds a new flow or modifies an existing one.\n\nWith Prism, developers get insight into what's broken on day one. No event-tracking necessary.\n\n# **Solution**\n\nPrism uses vision models to watch session replays and identify friction. For our customers, it's like having a support engineer sit with every one of their users.\n\nPeople get value from Prism in one of two ways.\n\n### 1. Semantic search\n\n_Rather than watching hundreds of hours of session replays, developers can ask “what are the main pain points users are experiencing?”_\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90346&key=user_uploads/551584/e3e366c0-be08-4b7d-a351-dd8f6deea3f3)\n\n### 2. Insight generation\n\n_Prism identifies what the issue is, who’s experiencing it, and what a developer can do to resolve it._\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90346&key=user_uploads/551584/fc5fd965-6693-45d1-ae61-a323920f205e)\n\n# One more thing...\n\nWhile building software may be increasingly commoditized, we believe that the relationship people have with their users will never be. Prism is an AI that enables our customers to know their users better than they know themselves.\n\nIf you want to become customer-obsessed, you can get started at [prismreplay.com](http://prismreplay.com).\n\nYou can also book a demo to chat with us at [cal.com/team/prismai/demo](http://cal.com/team/prismai/demo).",

        "body": "Today, we’re launching QualGent, an AI Quality Assurance agent for mobile that helps companies catch more bugs and ship much faster without hiring more human QA testers. One customer hit **#3 in the App Store’s Education category** by improving their app quality and release process with QualGent.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/k1eSm6QvO9c\n\n**🐛 The Problem: Mobile QA is a Bottleneck**\n\nShipping a great mobile app is hard. Even top teams struggle with flaky end-to-end tests, missed edge cases, and regressions that slip past CI.\n\nScript-based automation tools like Playwright, Selenium, Appium or Espresso break often. Visual diff tools miss functional bugs. And in-house human QA teams can’t scale with today’s release cycles.\n\nCTOs, VPs, Directors of Eng, and QA leads at fast-growing companies are asking:\n\n> Why does our test suite say green when our users say broken?\n\n**🛠️ Why We Built This: From frustrated mobile engineers to reinventing QA**\n\nWe’ve been mobile engineers at Google who shipped products like Android XR, Quick Share, Stadia, and foldable phones. We’ve seen firsthand how slow, flaky QA can derail a great product. We built QualGent so teams can catch real bugs faster, ship with confidence, and stop wasting time maintaining fragile tests.\n\nWe're grateful to be part of the YC community and excited to bring modern AI to a painful, expensive problem that slows down almost every mobile team we’ve met.\n\n**⚙️ The Solution: QualGent - Your AI QA Copilot**\n\nQualGent uses computer-use LLM agents and vision models to mimic a real human tester:\n\n1. You describe a test in natural language (“Sign up, go to settings, change theme”)\n2. Our AI agent runs that test on real iOS and Android devices in the cloud\n3. It taps, swipes, scrolls, types, speaks, listens - just like a human\n4. And gives you video, logs, and test reports for every step\n\nNo more rigid scripting. No more emulator-only limits. No more test maintenance hell.\n\nOur AI agent self-heals, handles dynamic pop-up content, navigates unexpected UI changes, and catches bugs like a pro.\n\n**🧠 Our Vision: Complete the AI coding-testing loop to ship quality products 100x faster**\n\nOur vision is to close the loop on software creation. As AI enables engineers to code 100x faster, QualGent eliminates the next bottleneck—software verification—unlocking truly scalable, end-to-end product-driven software development.\n\n**📢 Try it and Help Us Spread the Word: Let’s reimagine mobile QA together**\n\n1. Book a demo with us and see QualGent in action on your app!\n2. Know someone leading mobile engineering? We’d love a warm intro.\n\nWe rethought what QA could be with AI, you’ll want to test this. Let’s make releasing great mobile apps a joy again.\n\nhttps://qualgent.ai\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90415&key=user_uploads/297983/ad94ce99-b2ca-43c6-91b8-0131fbe39fc2)\n\n",

By analyzing all session replays, we extract behavior patterns that drive retention & revenue – without requiring manual event tracking. We sell to product teams at high growth startups like Delve, Conduit, etc.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dvt3COkC-U\n\n**Can’t watch all your session replay videos?** We’d love to talk to you: [founders@humanbehavior.co](mailto:founders@humanbehavior.co) or https://cal.com/humanbehavior-founders/30min \n\n**❌ The Problem**\n\nTwo options to understand how your product is used:\n\n1. Product analytics (like Mixpanel or Amplitude): Great for aggregating data but miss user context.\n2. Session replays capture absolutely everything, but there's no good way to aggregate them to learn anything useful.\n\n\"How many users abandon my product after a long LLM generation time? How long do enterprise vs free users spend on feature X?\" These questions become difficult to answer with traditional methods.\n\n**💡Our Solution**\n\nWe built Human Behavior to give you the best of both worlds using vision AI that actually watches your users. No more choosing between high-level analytics or drowning in session videos!\n\nWithout AI, thousands of session videos can be overwhelming. Now you'll never have to set manual feature tracking again – retroactively explore feature usage patterns from all your past users without wasting engineering time and effort.\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D12guaaJeJ8\n\n**👬 The Team**\n\nWe're Amogh (Stanford CS), Skyler (Berkeley CS), and Chirag (UChicago CS) and we've spent countless hours watching session replays ourselves. We worked on VLM research at Stanford NLP Group and UChicago Database Group, commercializing it to give the best customer behavior insights.\n\n**🤝Our ask:** \n\n* Check us out at https://www.humanbehavior.co/!\n* Stay in touch! If you know any companies with too many replays, we'll watch it for them! We'd also love to understand how you'd use the product. Email us at [founders@humanbehavior.co](mailto:founders@humanbehavior.co) \n* If you like what you see, we'd love to chat! Book a call with us here: https://cal.com/humanbehavior-founders/30min\n\n \n\n_(P.S. Thanks to [gatekeep.ai](http://gatekeep.ai) for letting us use their data for a demo!)_",

Yet, many teams still use outdated tools or spreadsheets that aren’t built for complex data from LLMs and AI agents. This slows down iteration, drives up costs, and makes model performance unpredictable in real-world use.\r\n\r\nWith Besimple, you can generate your own platform for annotating AI evaluation and training data instantly.  Simply paste or stream any type of raw data—text, chat, audio, video, or LLM outputs—and we'll instantly generate a tailored annotation interface, clear guidelines, and an automated human-in-the-loop workflow.  Our AI Judges quickly learn from human annotations, take over labeling for easy cases, and evaluate live production data, letting your team focus only on critical edge cases.\r\n\r\nKey differentiators\r\n1. Instant custom UI - Automatically generate tailored annotation interfaces just by uploading your data. Adjust easily whenever data or needs change.\r\n2. Tailored guidelines – Import any existing guidelines or we will draft new ones aligned with your business goals, ready for annotation\r\n3. AI Judges for real-time evaluation – AI-powered judges continuously improve by learning human preferences, automatically labeling data and flagging tough cases for expert review.\r\n4. Enterprise-grade deployment – On-prem optional install, and robust user management for internal SMEs, external vendors, or Besimple’s vetted annotators.\r\n5. Lightning-Fast Setup: No code, no plugins—just drop in your data, set guidelines, and you’re good to go.\r\n\r\nToday we power evaluation and training pipelines for leading AI companies in customer support, search, education, and more.  For example, the leading AI grading company Edexia uses besimple to annotate hundreds of decisions and improve their evals.\r\n\r\nBesimple is built by a team that has done this before. Yi Zhong and Bill Wang built the annotation platform for Meta’s Llama models, significantly improving quality of data and shortening model development cycle.\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\n\r\nIf you’re building an AI product and struggle with good eval or training data —or if you have models in prod with no idea why they fail—let’s talk. We’ll show you how to launch a custom annotation flow in a minute, bootstrap an AI Judge in an afternoon, and start shipping better models tomorrow.",

        "body": "Hey there!  We are [Yi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yzhong94/) and [Bill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/8illwang/), from [Besimple AI](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/besimple-ai)!  Struggling with data annotation?  Keep reading!\n\n💎 **TLDR**\n\nWith Besimple, you can generate your own platform for annotating AI eval and training data instantly.  Simply paste or stream any type of raw data and we'll instantly generate a tailored annotation interface, clear guidelines, an automated human-in-the-loop workflow, and AI judges to scale your insights.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw-EVKdOhds\n\n## **❌ The Problem**\n\nHigh-quality, human-reviewed data is essential for improving AI models. But teams today face significant challenges:\n\n* **Complex LLM Workflows**: Most AI startups and even the largest AI companies use spreadsheets for annotations to “move fast”. It is brittle. And it breaks down quickly for dynamic, multimodal, agent-based LLM use cases.\n* **Annotation Bottlenecks**: As models get better, only domain experts and someone on your team can improve model performance.  They quickly get overwhelmed when guidelines and data change constantly. This is expensive and slows model iteration.\n* **No Feedback Loop**: After a model ships, interesting production data isn’t automatically fed back into evaluation or training, missing opportunities for ongoing improvement.\n\n## **✅ Our Solution:** \n\n1. Instant custom UI: Just paste or stream your data and we create a custom annotation UI for your task.  We support text, chat, audio, video, LLM traces, and more. \n2. Tailored guidelines: Import any existing guidelines or we will draft new ones aligned with your business goals, ready for annotation\n3. AI Judges for real-time evaluation: LLM-based “judges” continuously learn from incoming annotations to evaluate live traffic and flag borderline cases for human review.\n4. Enterprise-grade deployment: On-prem optional install, and robust user management for internal SMEs, external vendors, or Besimple’s vetted annotators.\n5. Lightning fast setup: No code, no plugins—just drop in your data, set guidelines, and you’re good to go.\n\n**Traction:** The leading AI grading company Edexia uses besimple to annotate hundreds of decisions and improve their evals.\n\n## **The Team**\n\nWe’re **Yi Zhong** and **Bill Wang** —who built the annotation platform for Meta’s Llama models. We founded Besimple AI to help everyone spin up a Scale AI in 60s.\n\n# **🙏 Our asks**\n\nWe’re on a mission to make _continuous, high-quality data_ the easiest part of AI development. If that resonates, let’s chat!\n\n1. Reach us at [**founders@besimple.ai**](mailto:founders@besimple.ai)\n2. Book demo [here](https://calendly.com/yi-besimple/besimple-ai-intro-call).\n3. Or join our self-serve waitlist on our [website](https://besimple.ai/)!\n\nWe’ll show you how to launch a custom annotation platform in under a minute!",

        "body": "Hello everyone, \n\nWe’re Mateo and Marco, and we're excited to introduce Jazzberry, an AI agent for finding bugs. Jazzberry is powered by running your code in a secure sandbox and integrates directly into your pull request workflow on GitHub.\n\n**Try it here →** <https://jazzberry.ai>\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ZTu86qK8U>\n\n**Why we built Jazzberry**\n\nAI code generation has dramatically increased the amount of code that is written without the tools for bug finding keeping up, leading to a world with more buggy code that is hindering developers. To improve bug finding, we’ve created an AI agent with the ability to run snippets of your code. We're not just flagging potential issues based on code patterns; we're observing the real behavior of your software. Here’s how it works.\n\n1. When you create a pull request, Jazzberry gets to work.\n2. Your repository is cloned into a microVM.\n3. Our agent examines the contents of the pull request to guide its search. It can write and execute code in the microVM as it looks for bugs.\n4. Jazzberry returns a clear markdown table directly as a comment.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90047&key=user_uploads/2557020/31d75b00-abc3-4a60-8ef5-b3a685edfcd5)\n\n**Real Bugs, Real Impact**\n\nWe've already seen Jazzberry make a tangible difference for our early users. So far, Jazzberry has…\n\n* successfully identified a SQL injection vulnerability\n* discovered a critical logical error in API key validation\n* [found an incorrect page navigation](https://blog.openint.dev/how-we-scale-prs/) (see below, we are formerly known as Prophet)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90047&key=user_uploads/2557020/864328cf-c4b9-4b9a-b267-e9059a158f32)\n\n**Who we are**\n\nWe have been friends for over a decade, and are coming together to create Jazzberry. Marco completed his MS at the University of Stellenbosch specializing in LLMs for automated test suite generation. Mateo completed his PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder with a research focus on reinforcement learning and formal methods.\n\n**Our Ask**\n\n* **Try it out** – Jazzberry is available now with a free trial at <https://jazzberry.ai>.\n* **Contact us** – We’d love to hear your feedback and what bugs Jazzberry helps you catch. Reach us at [founders@jazzberry.ai](mailto:founders@jazzberry.ai).",

Let’s connect: [founders@vesence.com](mailto:founders@vesence.com).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr1Q7S6A84I\n\n**Problem:**\n\nImagine programming in Apple Notes.\n\nNo linting, no cursor, you are on your own.\n\nThat is how it is for many lawyers to draft and review contracts in Microsoft Word.\n\nAt law firms, the stakes are extremely high. Every mistake can hurt your reputation badly. Associates need to deliver under time pressure, partners demand extreme attention to detail, and your clients will not accept any blunders.\n\nGiven the attention to detail needed in the work, working on complex projects under constant time pressure, we are starting with quality-assuring agents (i.e. a linting system for contracts).\n\nThe consequences of shipping \"bugs\" in a legal document can be catastrophic, but even the best firm still rely on manual review to catch mistakes.\n\n**What We’ve Built**\n\nVesence offers quality assurance AI agents available straight in Microsoft Word to handle tasks such as:\n\n* **Apply firm-wide Standards**: Apply writing style guides and best practices consistently across all practice groups in the firm\n* **Ensure project-level alignment**: Flag inconsistencies across multiple deal documents, for example auto-checking the SPA against the original term sheet\n* **Verify document consistency**: Catch defined term slips, bad cross-references, logical gaps, and miscalculations within a single document\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90570&key=user_uploads/2486274/99f83828-eeb2-4d36-9c69-e8401e4ab7b5)\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nLet’s hear it from our users:\n\n“You saved me 4 hours last night.”\n\n“I’m never sending out a document/project again unless I’ve used Vesence.”\n\n“This is how AI should feel like. Intuitive and extremely helpful.”\n\n**Associates** love Vesence as they can produce exceptional internal deliveries under less pressure to seniors and partners. **Partners** love the tool as their teams hand them better quality work and follows the firm’s best practices.\n\nThe interest we have seen from transactional law firms is great, but we also received inbound from other professional service providers that care deeply about quality and the reputation of their firms, including Investment Banks and Management Consultants.\n\nBasically, the holy trinity of where the ‘pls fix’ culture thrives.\n\n**Who We Are**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90570&key=user_uploads/2486274/e3b7f4e8-f03a-448d-9af8-fabe96a9feea)\n\nThe founders **Henrik Hansson** and **Ludvig Swanström** have known each other for 8 years, and worked together at the YC startup Depict S20 (founded by the CEO and Founder of Lovable).\n\nTo build Vesence, we spent a couple of months living at a law firm, to refine the product and user experience alongside lawyers.\n\nWe have already rolled out the product firm-wide at a law firm.\n\n**Our Ask**\n\nKnow any partners, innovation managers, or associates at transactional law firms? Please connect us!\n\nHave you ever worked at a law firm, management consultancy firm, or an investment bank and faced brutal pls fix tasks? Please share them with us!\n\nReach out to us at: [founders@vesence.com](mailto:founders@vesence.com)",

Integrate enterprise-grade MCP servers with your AI application in a minute, and scale to millions of users using our open-source, hosted MCP servers with multi-tenancy auth, and skip MCP client-side development hassle.\n\n**Ask:** Can you introduce us to companies working on AI agents and applications that need different external integrations? Contact us at [xiangkaiz@klavis.ai](mailto:xiangkaiz@klavis.ai).\n\nLaunch video: https://youtu.be/HFn5xWC6cAk\n\n**The Problem**\n\n* **Missing Native Authentication & User-based Authentication:** Lack of built-in and user-based authentications in MCP servers creates security risks and adds development complexity, hindering production use.\n* **Lack of Enterprise-Grade Servers:** Available MCP servers are frequently underdeveloped personal projects, lacking stability, features, and remote capabilities essential for enterprise environments.\n* **Client-Side Connection Barrier**: Accessing MCP servers requires developing the clients, creating technical overhead and hindering adoption, especially for existing function calling infrastructures that lack native MCP support.\n\n**The Solution**\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcq7Lridm_hh7ACd4DFh6Zcsc38dMU3Kp8X9MdK55P_JuQVQ-ZMA6Pc75Qs7C0wc3vDdjlMOVmTCHNVZ-5MUpNbrLibGrFzzcARZme9csIpjPP5yENtddc01TW1newc1A1pGFepKw?key=HpOTxrRvVOxut3yp-iTaNhMb)\n\nKlavis AI solves these problems by:\n\n* **Secure, Enterprise-Grade Hosted Servers:** Launch stable, enterprise-grade MCP servers instantly via API. Our hosted solution includes built-in OAuth & multi-tenancy auth, eliminating security gaps and complexity.\n* **Skip Client Development Hassle:** Use our API to connect any remote MCP servers from your existing backend, or let users interact immediately through our pre-built Web, Slack, and Discord clients.\n* **Trust Through Open Source:** Our MCP servers and clients are open source, ensuring transparency and fostering community trust.\n\n**Concrete Example**\n\nImagine you want your AI agent to interact with your company's Jira. Instead of building a custom Jira integration and wrestling with authentication, use Klavis AI. With simple API calls, you instantly get a secure, hosted Jira MCP server ready to go. It handles OAuth and user-level authentications automatically, letting your AI securely query tickets right away – no MCP client coding required.\n\n**Why Us**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90202&key=user_uploads/259581/6621b1de-ea41-46f4-bc9e-97b0676a7c97)\n\nXiangkai previously worked as a Senior Software Engineer on the Google Gemini at Google Deepmind. His work involves building the function calling infrastructure for Gemini and supporting multiple Gemini agentic feature launches. The challenges in the MCP space resonate strongly with his background, and he's very excited to bring his insights and energy to accelerate innovation here.\n\nZihao previously worked on Lyft’s Rider team and Nordstrom’s analytical data platform team, with expertise in scaling systems for millions of users and NLP background from University and Master studies.\n\n**🙏 Our Asks**\n\n* **Share & Intro:** Can you share this post and introduce us to companies working on AI agents and applications that need different external integrations?\n* **Connect:** Email me at [xiangkaiz@klavis.ai](mailto:xiangkaiz@klavis.ai) if you’d like to learn more or chat.",

Email [win@paraquery.com](mailto:win@paraquery.com) or sign up [here](https://paraquery.com/waitlist)!\n\n**4x'ing** BigQuery efficiency with ParaQuery: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu379YnccGU> \n\n# **The Problem**\n\nData is the new oil and you're feeding your products with a bunch of it. But to do so, you need to build, maintain, and optimize your data infra. That's either a huge timesink, or you're bleeding cash to ignore it, or someone is breathing down your neck about this month's cloud bill. Why can't we just ship features?\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90162&key=user_uploads/1091672/419acb3d-1195-4842-a80e-df02ac0d332f)\n\nWhether it's those 20-minute+ Presto queries, or your exploding BigQuery bill (which happens to be tracked in real time), your data infra is letting you down.\n\n# **Our Solution**\n\nParaQuery runs on highly-parallel, throughput-optimized cloud-available hardware, perfect for data processing workloads: **GPUs**!\n\nOur system abstracts out the infra required to serverlessly accelerate your logic. With the extreme efficiency of GPUs, it's half the cost and double the performance of competing solutions like Databricks and BigQuery, without any platform commitments.\n\nFor SQL-based data warehouses like BigQuery, you can use ParaQuery with minimal changes to your queries. And since it's fully Spark-compatible, there's no vendor lock-in. It integrates with literally anything which has a Spark connector, on any major cloud. We can even deploy on GPU clouds.\n\nParaQuery makes data processing as simple as specifying:\n\n1. Inputs\n2. Output\n3. Logic\n4. Run!\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90162&key=user_uploads/1091672/a6cded39-2da7-432b-9129-014a593caaae)\n\n# **Why?**\n\nI've been looking into GPUs and parallel programming for over 12 years – starting out with crypto. I left that field pretty fast, but I never stopped thinking about efficient compute and GPU acceleration. Even more so when, years later, I had to wait for my laptop to finish 18-hour physics simulations. And during my professional career, I've also had to wait on my fair share of 20-minute+ analytical queries.\n\nIn fact, I hate waiting. ParaQuery is productizing an arbitrage of hardware efficiency, and I'm not waiting any longer to do so.\n\n# **Ask**\n\n1\\. If you know anyone who is running any big data processing scenarios (including MLOps), I'd love to learn more about their use case and see if we're a fit! \n\n2\\.

We're bringing in our deep knowledge of modifying equipment and integrating it into factories keenly understanding what makes hardware hard. \r\n\r\nWe take in parts under consideration, constraints and tasks at hand and our algorithm formulates and fine tunes from 100s of possible design options. All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams. We already have two paying customers in the OEM and system integrator spaces. \r\n\r\nWe are venture backed and supported by a GBP 2.5MM grant by ARIA, the UK Government's invention agency. ",

        "body": "We’re Ayna and Andrew, and we’re building [MorphoAI](https://morpho.ai/). We’re a team of manufacturing tech experts and MIT PhDs who have written 30+ papers on foundational research of AI design methods for robotics engineering. We met at Harvard last year and decided to help people develop hardware at the speed of software. \n\nIn our research, we demonstrated capabilities that allowed engineers to generate 100s of verified optimal designs from parts and task requirements in minutes, and now we’re translating those findings to a product for robotics & automation. We’re cutting R&D cycles by 50 %+ and letting teams ship better hardware, faster!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGmXIsoUc2Y&feature=youtu.be\n\n### **Problem**\n\nDesigning a new robot, machine, or work‑cell still feels like 1985: weeks of manual CAD drawing, long prototype‑and‑test loops, and “does it even work?” uncertainty. A single product can take 40‑100 iterations and burn through months of engineering time. This all amounts to $240B spent on mechanical design each year. https://www.morpho.ai/ \n\n### **Our Take**\n\nWhat if you could take requirements and ideas into _validated machine designs_ automatically? We’re building that for hardware—so engineers can explore more, better-performing designs, fine-tune the ones likely to work, and land on an optimal design before the first part is cut. Engineers input and tasks and constraints (_what the robot must do)_ and their favorite parts to build with, and MorphoAI’s software auto‑generates, verifies, and fine tunes manufacturable designs in minutes—cutting R&D cycles by 50 %+ and letting teams ship new hardware faster. \n\n### **The MorphoAI Platform**\n\n1. **Generate** hundreds of verified design candidates from parts and task requirements in minutes, and select the concepts to fine-tune.\n2. **Simulate** full‑dynamical behavior with optimal, verified controllers.\n3. **Optimize** for cost, performance, weight, manufacturability, and more.\n\nThe result is a ready‑to‑manufacture machine design, programmable motions, and BOM—delivered in minutes, not months.\n\n### **Team**\n\n* **Ayna Arora** (CEO, Co-founder) – Harvard Business School; Former VC, 2x founder in manufacturing tech setting up factories across the world.\n* **Andy Spielberg, PhD** (CTO, Co-founder) – MIT CSAIL; Harvard PostDoc (digital manufacturing). 30+ papers on Optimization algorithms in robotics design.\n* Founding team: Allan Zhao (MIT PhD on GenAI for robot design), Amira Abdel-Rahman (Havard + MIT PhD on design for hardware) Han Wang (simulation expert in research+industry).\n\nWe’re also backed by ARIA (UK Government’s Invention Agency) with a 2.5MM GBP Grant.\n\n### **What’s Possible Today**\n\nOur early users are:\n\n* Resizing robot geometry and motors to maximize reach and payloads.\n* Redesigning workcells to minimize costs, design time, and improve margins.\n* Auto-generating new end-of-arm tooling designs from parts in hours, not weeks\n\n### **Big Picture**\n\nMorphoAI is the “compiler” for the physical world. As we expand our capabilities, any company will be able to invent machines that were previously infeasible— shrinking $MM R&D budgets and accelerating everything from factory automation to medical innovation to planetary exploration.\n\n### **Let’s Talk**\n\nBuilding a new robot or a new cutting-edge machine? We’d love to talk. Drop us a note at [**hello@morpho.ai**](mailto:hello@morpho.ai) .",

I’m [Aman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandeep-singh0/) (ex-trader from Tower Research and Goldman Sachs), building **Scalar Field** with my co-founder [Ramakant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramakant-yadav1/) (ex-Microsoft).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOwJB5R4HxA\n\n### **The Problem We're Solving**\n\nWhy does anyone log in to a trading terminal like Bloomberg or FactSet?\n\nBecause — whether consciously or subconsciously — there’s a **hypothesis in their mind**. Something they're trying to validate as they jump across **charts, news, fundamentals, and macros**.\n\nBut here’s the issue: **Terminals today are built like giant dashboards**.\\\nWhat traders and analysts actually want is to **test and validate ideas**, not just observe data. So we asked ourselves — why not **rebuild the terminal from scratch** to do exactly that?\n\n---\n\n### **What We’re Building**\n\nAt **Scalar Field**, we’re reimagining the trading terminal from the ground up using **intelligent agents**. We started with retail traders as a way to build credibility with institutions—and already have around 800 paying traders, over 34,000 signups, and **$74,000** in monthly revenue.\n\nOur goal is simple:\\\n**Let users test any market hypothesis instantly — and intelligently.**\n\nWe’re building a terminal that can:\n\n→ **Run compute-heavy backtests** across multiple datasets (fundamentals, prices, macro, alternative data)\\\n→ **Spin up agents** that reorganize dashboards based on new signals or events\\\n→ **React to live market changes** and even **initiate trades** when conditions match your criteria\\\n→ **Persist memory across sessions** — so your research trail is never lost\\\n→ **Chain multi-hop workflows:** e.g., _If ETF flows spike and earnings surprises drop, highlight affected sectors and show next trade ideas_\n\nIt’s not just data access — it’s **agent-driven insight and action**.\n\n---\n\n### **🚀 Try it Now: [Scalar Field](https://scalarfield.io)**\n\n---\n\n### **🎁 YC Deal**\n\nWe’re offering **2 months of Pro+ free** to all **YC X25 founders and alums**.\\\nUse code **YCOMBINATOR** or just email us: [**founders@scalarfield.io**](mailto:founders@scalarfield.io)\n\n---\n\n### **What We’re Looking For:**\n\n* **Feedback** from LLM / infra builders\n* **Warm intros** to PMs, RIAs, analysts, or macro researchers\n* **Ideas** on scaling persistent memory + multi-hop reasoning\n\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts!\n\n— **Aman & Ramakant**\\\n📧 [founders@scalarfield.io](mailto:founders@scalarfield.io)",

We are building microfactories that can handle the upcoming wave of AI-designed drugs and safeguard against biothreats.\n\n[Launch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_lJOs7k7nI)\n\n### **The Problem**\n\nAmerica is at risk of ceding leadership in advanced biomanufacturing to China.\n\n* **Drug manufacturing is moving to China;** 79% of US biotech and pharma companies already have at least one contract with a Chinese firm, _primarily because they are faster._\n* **China is investing billions in biotech**; one third of new compounds licensed by US pharma are now _discovered and manufactured_ in China, up from almost none five years ago.\n* **Over-reliance on foreign biomanufacturing is a national-security risk;** agile, on-shore manufacturing is critical to protect our nation against future biothreats.\n\n### **Our Solution**\n\nA contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) for advanced drugs, rebuilt from the ground up to address the future of America’s biomanufacturing needs.\n\n* **Faster biomanufacturing**; Our platform leverages advanced methods to accelerate production timelines and de-risk scale-up.\n* **Modular container factories**; our form factor is a standard shipping container that can be brought up to operation in roughly two weeks and shipped where it is needed.\n* **Supply-chain independence;** by vertically integrating and manufacturing critical equipment in-house, we secure production against global disruptions.\n\n### **Why It Matters**\n\n* **Drugs can be developed faster**; shorter production cycles move life-saving drugs from the lab to the clinic up to a year sooner.\n* **More drugs can be developed**; we will be able to manufacture the thousands of low-volume, personalized biologics that will be designed by AI.\n* **Strengthening US autonomy;** rapid-deploy, U.S.-based capacity protects the nation from supply shocks, geopolitical turbulence, and potential bioweapons.\n\n### **Who We Are**\n\nWe love biomanufacturing. Together, we built Protein Evolution, an industrial biotech company that turned plastic waste into new textile fibers. Scott is ex-McKinsey and a Yale mathematician (he loves a good cost model almost as much as he loves America). Mike earned his PhD in Bioengineering from Penn after completing Penn’s M&T program in undergrad (he builds DNA, software, and bioreactors).\n\n### **Our Ask**\n\n**Please reach out** if you work in drug development, work at a CDMO, or have experience working with or at the FDA: [**founders@bramantebio.com**](mailto:founders@bramantebio.com)\n\n**Follow along** on our journey:\n\n* [**www.bramantebio.com**](http://www.bramantebio.com)\n* [**www.linkedin.com/company/bramante-biologics**](http://www.linkedin.com/company/bramante-biologics)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90667&key=user_uploads/547597/1ed9b2f2-f6d9-4253-b3b0-f7561d246977)\n\n_Let’s build the infrastructure tomorrow’s medicine deserves, right here at home._",

They overload you with notifications, bury important messages, and force you to manually manage threads, tasks, and follow-ups. Meanwhile, most “AI” email tools are just bolt-on features, slow, clunky, and unaware of the full context of your inbox.\n\n**Our Solution**\\\nZero is built from the ground up as an **AI-native email platform**. That means every part of your experience, from prioritization to replies, is powered by a deep understanding of your inbox and your workflow. Zero doesn’t just help you **handle** email, it helps you get **ahead** of it.\n\n* AI that thinks like a human assistant, not a search algorithm\n* Real-time summaries and smart organization that adapts to your day\n* A seamless way to interact with your email through natural conversation\n* Fully open source for complete transparency\n\n**Try Zero**\n\nInstead of drowning in an endless stream of emails, Zero gives you a live, intelligent inbox you can actually control.\n\nWe just launched our public beta at [**0.email**](http://0.email).\n\nIf you’d like to chat with us or learn more:\n\n📅 Book a meeting: [**https://cal.com/team/0/chat**](https://cal.com/team/0/chat)\n\n📧 Email us: [**founders@0.email**](mailto:founders@0.email)",

        "body": "**TL;DR:** AI-powered truck management software to automate back-office operations for trucking companies.\\\n[**Check us Out!**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18BF2PM5YkSSTOXs9yqM_CQ0jv2Gy9xFD/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**The Problem and Solution:**\n\nTrucking has always been a mission critical industry, with nearly 70% of all US goods hauled via trucks, resulting in a need for continuous operations. This results in an industry that hasn’t paused for a tech update in years; in my time in the industry, I saw dozens of offices running on pen and paper or excel spreadsheets, documents being sent in WhatsApp group chats connected to printers, and I myself had 3 phones all on hold menus with different people. And even the largest of companies today navigate a maze of outdated, poorly integrated point-solutions.\n\nSo, alongside Anthony and Sam, I decided to build a product that rectifies those problems. With Hemut’s software, you can replace pen and paper scribbles with intuitive oversight of even national level fleets, replace the WhatsApp group chats and manual data entry with AI document parsing, and eliminate the need for 3 phones with AI agents to automate inbound/outbound calls. With Hemut, trucking companies can execute every step of the trucking workflow—from finding and booking a shipment, driver communication, and logging every last dollar—all on one platform, with efficiency never seen before.\n\n**The Story:**\n\nAt 16 years old, I got kicked out of my home and faced homelessness, working 100-hour weeks at a motel where I met a truck driver who I eventually helped file paperwork for. Siezing the opportunity, I also helped file paperwork for his friends too, eventually saving enough money to start dispatching trucks and put a roof over my head.\n\nFast forward 6 years to the end of 2024, I realized that voice AI would eventually be capable enough to automate a lot of the bottlenecks I encountered during my time in the logistics industry.\n\n**Our Ask:**\n\nAlways looking to learn about the cutting edge of tech and the people driving the innovation so feel free to say hi. If you also happen to know anyone in the trucking industry (veteran trucker. investor, or dev), we’d love to be introduced!\n\n**Contact:** [cheema@hemut.com](mailto:cheema@hemut.com)",

        "body": "Hey YC, we’re [João](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaopdepaula/), [Lucas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasbrunosilva/), and [Sergio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergio-bergmann/), cofounders of [**Mesmer**](http://mesmer.co/) — **Cursor for CTOs.**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMO7TQUZIuU\n\nWe’re **repeat founders and CTOs behind startups like Glio (S13) and [Origin Financial](http://useorigin.com/) ($400M)**. In every team we built, we ran into the same challenge: each new customer, employee, and feature made it harder to understand what was actually going on. We spent our days in back-to-back meetings and chasing status updates, and forced our teams to do busywork just to keep us in the loop. **Yet we still didn’t see problems until something broke**.\n\nAI is already making the 10x engineer possible. But there’s no solution that helps **product development orgs — and product leaders — 10x themselves**. That’s what we’re building.\n\n# **Enter Mesmer**\n\n**Mesmer gives founders and CTOs full context on their org without drowning in meetings or chasing people for updates**. It watches the work itself — code, specs, designs, meetings — to build a live, detailed picture of what’s going on. Our customers can keep their teams fast, flat, and focused as they scale — and free from busywork.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90395&key=user_uploads/178/c0f0220d-62be-4e38-9246-ecd3c2493a79)\n\nWe are starting with **an AI chief of staff for product development orgs**. Every week, it delivers a report showing what actually happened across all in-flight projects: what moved forward, what shipped, and what’s stuck. Founders and CTOs can then ask questions and get in-depth answers based on their team’s actual code, specs, and designs, like:\n\n* Why is this project slipping?\n* Who’s the best engineer to unblock it?\n* What architecture did we use in this repo?\n* How does the business logic work for this categorization engine?\n* What changed in the roadmap last week?\n\n**We’re already live with 10+ companies worth over $3B** and have reviewed over 70M lines of code along the way. We’d love to help you, too.\n\n# **Special Offer**\n\nWe’re onboarding companies as fast as we can, but, if you’re a CTO leading a team of 20+ engineers (or know someone who is) **email me at [joao@mesmer.co](mailto:joao@mesmer.co) and we’ll skip the line** to help you run a flat, fast, focused org right away.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90395&key=user_uploads/178/0a177036-5476-45b7-bd33-cfd2b5fb72a3)\n\n",

We build the software these couriers use to handle the shipments, including a driver app and fleet management tools.

Companies are forced to choose between shipping fast or shipping secure. Engineering teams lose **\\~20%** of their time dealing with security issues or slowing down to accommodate outdated security practices.\n\n## 🚀 Our Solution\n\n[MindFort.ai](http://MindFort.ai)'s autonomous security agents work 24/7/365 to find, validate, and patch vulnerabilities:\n\n* **Find** complex vulnerabilities like a human tester would\n* **Validate** every finding to eliminate false positives\n* **Patch** with intelligent fixes that integrate directly with your codebase\n* **Scale** to thousands of tests in an instant, giving coverage never possible before\n\nUnlike solutions that slow development, MindFort accelerates it by eliminating security bottlenecks. Our platform is already finding vulnerabilities in production systems that other tools miss, identifying issues in bug bounty programs, and scoring high on human penetration testing benchmarks.\n\n## 💡 Our Story\n\nBrandon worked as a PM at ProjectDiscovery, a security scanner company where he led development of the Nuclei cloud platform from an open source tool to an enterprise ready product. He then joined NetSPI, one of the world’s largest penetration testing firms, to build generative AI tools for human testers. He sat with countless customers across both companies, learning about their struggles in securing attack surfaces at scale.\n\nAkul received his masters in computer science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and was drawn to AI and security early on in his academic career. He co-authored multiple papers on using LLMs to perform various cybersecurity attacks, worked on creating novel benchmarks for hacking agents, and participated in red teaming and model safety programs at both OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nSam worked as a senior engineer at Salesforce, where he led security for a large business unit, Tableau. During his time there, he worked first hand on keeping a large scale product secure. Between juggling security assessments, validating findings, and managing remediations inside of a large organization, he had seen it all. He began experimenting with ways to use AI to help solve some of the issues he faced at Salesforce and even worked on a demo of a tool to perform agentic code review through a DARPA program. He recently completed a master’s degree in cybersecurity at UC Berkeley.\n\nWe all met through our work and research. Early on, we all realized that the future of security was going to belong to AI agents, and that the coming tidal wave of new code generated with AI would need a solution of equal magnitude.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90555&key=user_uploads/525065/51cbc28d-9ff7-41b3-af19-d3e9fc23ef0a)\n\n## 🔮 Our Vision\n\nSecurity should accelerate your business, not slow it down. We're creating a world where security testing happens continuously and vulnerabilities are patched autonomously, **keeping your product and your users safe, while letting you ship faster.**\n\n## 👇 Our Ask\n\nReady to ship quickly and securely? 👉 **Visit [mindfort.ai](http://mindfort.ai) to request access**\n\n📧 Email us directly: [founders@mindfort.ai](mailto:founders@mindfort.ai)",

        "body": "Hi! We’re [Dmitry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrykarpov/), [Sergey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yudovskiy/), and [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/odinalex/) — co-founders of [WorkDone](https://www.wrkdn.com/).\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nEvery year, **250 million insurance claims — worth billions of dollars — are denied due to documentation errors**. Many are never recovered. We connect directly to hospital EHRs, monitor clinical staff activity logs in real time, and use AI agents to detect and fix compliance issues before they become risks. **Since the beginning of YC, we’ve reached $54k ARR** and have a growing number of commercial pilots with hospitals and clinics across the U.S. and PoCs with healthcare enterprises.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrcEY8WgmSk\n\n**Problem:**\n\nOne small documentation mistake — like recording a medication time incorrectly — can destroy a family’s finances.\n\nThese errors are often made by exhausted clinicians after 12-hour shifts and are caught by automated insurance systems that instantly deny the claim.\n\n**Hospitals don’t discover the problem until it's too late** — after the claim is denied, the audit triggered, or the reputation damaged.\n\nDocumentation errors are the invisible threat in modern healthcare. They’re not caused by negligence, but by broken systems: cluttered interfaces, overworked staff, and legacy EHRs that make it easy to click the wrong time, forget a discharge note, or miss a required signature.\n\n**And it’s not just claims** — these small errors lead to failed audits, regulatory fines, delayed discharges, and increased burnout.\n\nHospitals end up with compliance teams that are reactive — chasing mistakes days or weeks after they happened, often without resolution. The cost isn’t just money. It’s morale, trust, and patient safety.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWorkDone is an AI compliance autopilot that prevents small documentation errors from becoming costly disasters in real time.\n\nWe integrate directly with hospital EHRs, monitor clinical activity in real time, and use AI agents to detect and fix issues — like missed discharge notes or wrong medication times — before they trigger claim denials or audits.\n\nWhen a problem is found, our AI opens a quick conversation with the responsible staff member to confirm and correct it immediately.\n\n**We don’t just alert**. We resolve — and help hospitals run smoother, reduce pressure on teams, and recover revenue that would otherwise be lost.\n\n**What Experts Are Saying:**\n\n\"WorkDone’s proactive approach is a game‑changer in reducing preventable errors and enabling real‑time accountability in care delivery.”\n\n— [Joel N.H. Stern, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-n-h-stern-07a4342/)\\\nProfessor of Neurology & Molecular Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell\n\n**Team:**\n\n[Dmitry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrykarpov/) (CEO) and [Sergey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yudovskiy/) (CPO) are second-time YC founders with a strong track record in building B2B enterprise products and go-to-market channels. Sergey comes from a full medical family and has deep personal ties to the problems we're solving in healthcare. [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/odinalex/), (CTO), is a seasoned engineer who built apps used by 25M+ people worldwide and led the development of a full AI agent architecture at his previous multimillion-dollar startup.\n\n**Asks:**\n\nWe're actively looking to connect with:\n\n* **Hospital executives and clinic owners** who want to stop losing revenue to preventable compliance errors and team burnout \n* **Providers' CFOs and compliance leaders** who are tired of fighting with clinical staff over documentation and want a system that just works\n* **Medical institution advisors and operators** who care about transforming broken workflows\n* **Reporters and storytellers** covering the untold side of healthcare — the back office chaos that leads to financial disaster\n\nIf you're building, reporting on, or fighting to fix this problem — DM us, email us at [founders@wrkdn.com](mailto:founders@wrkdn.com), or grab 15 minutes with us here [Book a call](https://calendly.com/d/cnpv-x29-nzc/workdone-demo).\n\nLet’s save healthcare from the inside out.",

        "body": "Hey everyone, we’re Tim and Akshay – cofounders of **Rimba** 👋\n\n**TL;DR**\\\nAI, transportation, electricity... All run on massive amounts of energy, and America is running heading to an energy crisis. It’s incredibly difficult to build or operate energy projects, and REGULATORY COMPLIANCE requirements made it even harder. Energy companies are slapped with $$$ tens of millions in penalties while buried in a mountain of spreadsheets, PDFs, and forms to stay compliant.\n\nWe’re building **Rimba** to fix that.\n\n**\\*\\*Ask:\\*\\*\\\nKnow someone or work in energy (mom, dad, aunt, grandpa)? Introduce us [timothy@rimba.ai](mailto:timothy@rimba.ai) or send them our [LinkedIn Launch](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/y-combinator_rimba-yc-x25-is-ai-for-energy-industrial-activity-7329943880416612352-aryT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABs6HnMB3XNRo_a9KqN2METPAum-VybW7UA).**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoNWA6gVa6Y\n\n## **❌ The Problem**\n\n## Compliance today is manual, error-prone, and incredibly expensive. From low carbon fuel reports, like\n\n**LCFS, RFS,** to air permits, from tax credit filings to prevailing wage documentation, and more.\\\nA look at the numbers:\n\n* $23B+ is spent annually on energy compliance in the U.S.\n* $2B+ in annual fines\n* Not to mention the missed incentive and tax credit revenue. Plus 1,000s of hours lost spent on copy-pasting values across spreadsheets, data cleaning, and filings.\n\nAnd yet—there are **no modern tools** built for how energy producers actually operate: across spreadsheets, legacy software, and passing data back-and-forth.\n\n## **💡 Our Solution:**\n\n## **One Platform for Energy & Industrial Compliance Automation**\n\n## **Rimba** is building the compliance operating system for the industrial sector.\n\n1. We monitor and extract operational data from **any source**—ERP Data, meter data, PDF—and turn it into **clean, structured, and report-ready data**.\n2. Verify data and reports for regulations, such as:\n\n* LCFS / RFS / Air Permits\n* Prevailing Wage\n* Sustainability Certification\n\n1. Catch issues early and avoid mistakes that lead to costly penalties\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph3RtlbTy64\n\n## **✅ The Result**\n\n* **Millions avoided in fines**\n* **80% reduction** in time and resources on monitoring, data cleaning, and reporting.\n* **Reduction of risk through visibility**\n\n\\\n**🚀 The Team**\\\nBoth Tim and Akshay worked in regulatory compliance, and bonded together through the struggle and their love for burgers.\n\n[Follow Rimba on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rimba-compliance-automation/about/)\n\n* Tim (CEO) was formerly Head of Compliance and Legal Counsel at a mining and energy company. He spent years navigating a maze of regulations, environmental certification, and audit prep across spreadsheets, PDFs, and on-the-ground operational data. He didn’t just witness the problem. He lived it.\n* Akshay (CTO) was an AI Engineer at Klarity (W18) where he focused on transforming unstructured documents into structured data, streamlining compliance processes for finance and accounting teams. His experience includes building high-reliability systems at Goldman Sachs and Adobe; now he’s applying them to energy compliance.\\\n  \\\n  📩 Email us at [**timothy@rimba.ai**](mailto:timothy@rimba.ai)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90502&key=user_uploads/1078902/1bb07ce5-734a-42ad-90fb-6be5bd95609d)\n\n",

        "body": "Hey everyone 👋 we’re [Lalit](http://linkedin.com/in/lalitkundu) & [Catherine](http://linkedin.com/in/cat-catherine-zhao), co-founders of [Delty](http://delty.ai). \n\n# **TL;DR**\n\n🚀 Delty is _your_ AI Staff Engineer, trained on your team’s code, docs, and systems. With its deep systems understanding, it helps design and iterate upon enterprise-scale software systems.\n\nUse Delty to:\n\n* **Design** new features, services, or migrations with an expert AI teammate.\n* **Supercharge** AI coding agents like Copilot with systems and team context.\n* **Onboard** engineers fast—ask Delty how your systems works.\n\n**Ask:** Is your software engineering team seeing the gap between AI prototypes and enterprise-scale software implementation? Email [lalit@delty.ai](mailto:lalit@delty.ai) or [book a demo here](https://calendly.com/founders-delty/15-minute-meeting).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RymhaAeeOr4\n\n# **🚩 The Problem**\n\nThe most impactful engineering happens _outside_ the codebase, in designing systems, technical strategy, and implementation planning.\n\nBut today’s AI tools skip all that. They write code without understanding your systems or engineering norms, leading to tech debt, incidents, and rework.\n\nStaff engineers have expert systems knowledge, guide teams, and scale quality. AI tools can’t do that today. It looks good in demos, but breaks down in production.\n\n# **🛠️ Our Solution**\n\nWe’re a team of former Google staff engineers and AI experts building **Delty—AI that works like an expert enterprise engineer**, not just a code generator.\n\nDelty develops a **deep system-level understanding** of your codebase, team practices, product, and engineering norms. You onboard your context once and Delty becomes a persistent, trusted teammate.\n\nUse Delty to:\n\n* 🧠 **Design systems with a thinking partner**\n\n  Get first-pass design docs, architecture feedback, and tradeoff discussions\n\n  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90407&key=user_uploads/1494518/446133ae-9e63-4baf-a1c5-6a49a182bbfb)\n\n* ⚙️ **Supercharge your AI coding agents with system context**\\\n  Make Copilot or Cursor aware of your systems, dependencies, and conventions\n\n  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90407&key=user_uploads/1494518/cefc284e-dee4-4543-8bc4-8e6feeb05fe7)\n\n* 🧑‍💻 **Get 24/7 help from an experienced engineer**\\\n  Ask deep technical questions and get clear, informed answers\n\n  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90407&key=user_uploads/1494518/6be33ee2-0832-476b-8729-823bd1feddd9)\n\n\nHear from our users: _“Delty proposed an idea I hadn't even considered. It felt like pair-designing with a Staff Engineer who had been working at our company for years.”_ \n\n# **👫 The Team**\n\nLalit and Catherine built large-scale systems together at YouTube, handling billions in revenue. That’s where they first saw the gap: AI tools that could code, but couldn’t engineer.\n\n**Lalit** launched Google Pay in India and rose to Staff Engineer at YouTube in just six years. He led a 45-person team building monetization systems driving $XXB+ ARR. A lifelong programmer, his journey began with competing in the ACM-ICPC World Finals during college.\n\n**Catherine** started her career at YouTube as a SWE before joining Google’s APM program, where she worked on ChromeOS and internal GenAI infrastructure, including multimodal model evals and AI agents for enterprise use. She holds a BA in Computer Science from Dartmouth.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90407&key=user_uploads/1494518/dc1935e3-d2b0-4d83-9f63-b5cd8ae73e7b)\n\n# \n\n[🙏](https://emojipedia.org/folded-hands) **Asks**\n\n🚨 Running into scale issues with Copilot or codegen tools?\n\nDelty is live and helping teams already.\n\n* 👉 [Book a 15-min demo](https://calendly.com/founders-delty/15-minute-meeting) and see how an AI staff engineer actually helps.\n* 📩 Questions?

        "body": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nWe're [Eddie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddieconk/), [Logan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-carmody/), and [Max](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmpollard/) – co-founders of [Cotool](https://cotool.ai).\n\n### TL;DR\n\nCotool uses AI to automate repetitive security workflows so teams can focus on threat hunting instead of manual tasks. Our early users have used the copilot and agents to cut investigation time by 90% and increase detection quality & coverage. Book a demo to learn how you can do the same!\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnyZuJGQ5C0\n\n### ❌ The Problem\n\nSecurity is complex, but the problems facing most teams are not:\n\n1. Alert Fatigue: Hours lost to false positives, while genuine threats slip by unnoticed.\n2. Context Switching: Investigations requiring constant toggling across 5-10 disconnected tools just to assemble basic context.\n3. Documentation Overhead: Teams spend more time as technical writers than security practitioners, bogged down in endless reporting.\n\nBefore founding Cotool, we collaborated with cutting-edge security teams including OpenAI, Coinbase, Figma, and DoorDash, experiencing these universal challenges firsthand.\n\nAdvancements in AI now offer an opportunity to truly reimagine this model; by building intuitive, collaborative tools that complement, not replace, security professionals.\n\n### 👷 Our Solution\n\nCotool provides a suite of Agents and an AI co-pilot designed specifically for security teams, streamlining workflows and reducing frustration through:\n\n* Seamless Investigations 🔍: A true AI co-pilot that works alongside security engineers during alert triage, investigations, and detection engineering; automatically gathering relevant context from across tools so they can focus on reasoning, not tool-hopping.\n* No-code Agents 🤖: Turn successful debugging flows into reusable agents, then refine their behavior with natural language prompts and connect them to any tools Cotool has access to, with granular permission controls.\n* Automated Documentation 📊: Generating thorough, accurate reports in seconds, freeing up valuable security practitioner time.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90398&key=user_uploads/2254937/d59dd9d1-e396-4f77-8dce-283a5e31c4ee)\n\n### 👨‍💻 The Team\n\nWe have worked together for years and co-founded Cotool in 2025.\n\n[Max Pollard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmpollard/) (CEO) led the forward deployed engineering team at Material, working directly with security teams to understand their workflows and pain points. He built the team up from one to 8 engineers and embedded himself with the world's best security programs. Previously he worked as a SE at Okta. He holds a BA in Business and Computer Science from UC Berkeley.\n\n[Eddie Conk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddieconk/) (CPO + Head of AI) spent the last 3 years at Material Security, leading the ML Engineering function. He developed and trained AI models for detecting Phishing emails at scale for some of the largest and most secure companies in the world. Previously he was an ML Engineer at Apple, and holds a BA in Computer Science from UC Berkeley.\n\n[Logan Carmody](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-carmody/) (CTO) was an early engineer and the technical lead for the Phishing Protection product at Material Security. He helped develop the proprietary language and compiler which Material’s threat researchers used to detect Phishing messages and Workspace breaches. He previously was a Staff SWE at LinkedIn working in infrastructure, and holds a BS in Computer Science and Philosophy from Duke University.\n\nTogether, we've spent years embedded with some of the world's best security teams. We're passionate about helping security teams focus on what they do best – hunting threats, not handling workflows.",

Contact us at [marc@propolis.tech](mailto:marc@propolis.tech).\n\nHi! We’re Marc and Matt, tenured former leads of large and gnarly implementations and deployments at Palantir and Airtable (+ a bunch of startups!). We’re building Propolis.\n\n**❌ The Problem:** Software development cycles have accelerated substantially over the past year. Yet, testing remains stuck in the past, relying on either slow manual QA or brittle automation that breaks with every product change, creating three major pains:\n\n1. Wasted engineering time\n2. Delayed releases\n3. Bugs reaching real users\n\nThese intensify as companies scale, with some dedicating entire teams to QA or accepting that their users will find the bugs for them. But with Propolis, this is finally changing:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3AxEHNmTqyc\n\n**🐝 Our Solution:** Propolis deploys autonomous browser agents that think and behave like real users. They build an understanding of your application and communicate with one another. Teams simply provide a URL and credentials, and get access to:\n\n* **Complete test coverage** 🧪: AI agents explore your entire product, discovering and testing every possible user flow.\n* **Precise bug reporting** 🐛: Detailed reports delivered directly to Slack, Linear, Github, or wherever with videos, traces, and reproduction steps.\n\n**🙏 Our Ask:** If the above seems like something you or someone you know needs, please get in touch!\n\nWe're offering our next batch of customers:\n\n* A walkthrough of our agents traversing your application\n* Recently harvested honey for the next 10 companies that sign up! 🍯 (We're recreational beekeepers, hence the name)\n\nContact us at [marc@propolis.tech](mailto:marc@propolis.tech)\n\n**👬 The Team** Marc and Matt have both personally struggled with the reality of losing precious time QAing instead of shipping, countless hours clicking through flows and writing tests. They’ve bonded over their mutual fondness for deploying solutions that break the mold.\n\n[Marc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-papazian/) was previously Director of Product at an AI startup and a deployment lead at Palantir - where he led work building the operational data backbone for the entire Federal pandemic response. He makes wine halfway across the world in Armenia (ironically, he does NOT like wine).\n\n[Matt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattmattmattmatt/) was previously a senior engineer at Airtable, where he worked on infrastructure that helped eliminate the need for manual QA. He’s been frontline for hundreds of product releases and deploys, and knows what it takes to be confident in the code you’re shipping.",

It unifies your entire productivity stack behind one natural language interface, allowing you to create AI agents that work with your team in realtime, and can keep working while you sleep.\n\nWe want to deploy trillions of AI agents into the mainstream workforce and unlock the most productive era in human history.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90591&key=user_uploads/2367523/21ef304f-cb23-4dfa-b66e-fa68c0259206)\n\n### **The team**\n\n[**Linus Talacko**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linustalacko/) previously co-founded _Lyrebird Health_, one of Australia's fastest-growing startups, when he was 19. He scaled the team to 50+ people before leaving to start _Den_.\n\n[**Justin Lee**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin1ee/) previously built agents at _Atlassian_.

        "body": "Hey everyone! We’re [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samarthlamba/) and [Eshani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshanimehta/), the co-founders of Lumari 🔥\n\n**TL;DR:** Lumari empowers non-technical teams to spin up **fully integrated internal apps and agentic workers** without writing any code or wasting budget on inflexible off-the-shelf software.\n\nSee Lumari in action: https://youtu.be/iTZgUOUxcgE\n\n# **The Problem ❌**\n\n* Off-the-shelf software forces you into **one-size-fits-none** flows that never match your actual process\n* Internal tool requests sit unaddressed in engineering **backlogs** for months\n* Most “no-code” tools still require **complex code scripts** and hours of drag-and-drop work\n* You pay for 100 generic features to get the one you actually need\n\nThe build vs. buy decision is changing. Teams no longer have to choose between rigid tools and slow internal projects.\n\n# **Lumari’s Solution ✨**\n\nLumari empowers **anyone** to launch enterprise-ready internal apps with no code and no unnecessary SaaS spend.\n\n1. **Describe** your desired features, workflow, or task in plain English\n2. Lumari **generates** the UI, backend logic, and multi-step agentic flows\n3. We instantly **connect** your apps with deep integrations to your existing tools (CRM, Slack, docs, databases, etc)\n4. Internally **deploy** your scalable, secure app or agent without any engineering setup\n\nTeams use Lumari for deal-scoring alerts, call-coaching insights, contract to billing pipelines, customer-health dashboards, and a lot more.\n\n# **The Team**\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90564&key=user_uploads/1755497/3a1a90ce-6ebb-49fc-8c0e-6b1cd98be8fb)\n\n[Sam Lamba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samarthlamba/) is an ex-Google engineering lead who led the development of AI-driven features in Google Meet that scaled to millions of weekly enterprise users, and has received 2 AI patents. Sam also previously worked at Uber and Tesla and holds a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science from Duke University.\n\n[Eshani Mehta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshanimehta/) was previously at Stripe leading payments intelligence products handling $XXX million in volume. She also previously worked at Robinhood and Snap and studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley. \n\nSam and Eshani saw this exact bottleneck firsthand. At Google and Stripe, engineering teams had access to powerful, well-supported internal tools… because entire teams were dedicated to building them. But GTM teams weren’t as lucky. Internal requests from sales, ops, or customer teams often sat in backlogs for months, forcing teams to buy rigid tools that didn’t really fit their workflows. They started Lumari to fix that and give non-technical teams that same level of internal tooling power.\n\n# **Our Ask**\n\n* 📅 [Book a meeting](https://cal.com/team/lumari/lumari-demo) with us if this could be useful for you or your team\n* Follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lumari-io)!\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90564&key=user_uploads/1755497/15685d6f-2df7-42a6-851c-9372fbb56798)\n\n",

Engineers and technicians chase PLC logs, flip through outdated manuals, and rely on the one person who “just knows.” While production stalls, tribal knowledge disappears, and the same issues repeat.\n\n### **THE SOLUTION**\n\nLineWise centralizes critical knowledge by integrating siloed data from IoT sensors, maintenance records, and machine manuals. It ranks the most likely causes and guides the team to a fix in just **minutes**. But the best part? It remembers every issue for next time and advocates for preventative actions.\n\n---\n\n### **How LineWise Works**\n\n🔧 Upload an error code image or describe the issue in a message.\n\n🤖 The AI provides a refocused problem statement for confirmation.\n\n📊 The AI dynamically ranks possible hypotheses of causes by probability.\n\n🧠 A human validates each hypothesis to identify the true cause.\n\n🛠️ Resolve the issue by following a step-by-step guide.\n\n🔍 Conduct further investigation to uncover the root cause.\n\n📚 Enrich the knowledge base with insights from the issue and resolution.\n\n---\n\n### **Join Us to Revolutionize Manufacturing**\n\nLineWise partners with forward-thinking manufacturers to minimize unplanned downtime, empower frontline teams, and unlock the value of siloed data within a company. \n\nIf that sounds like you, we’d love to talk.\n\n🔧 **Want to see LineWise in action?** Contact: [info@linewise.io](mailto:info@linewise.io)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90196&key=user_uploads/2371704/9ed0ed2e-2221-436f-8407-534f1abd18a2)\n\n",

        "body": "Hey everyone! \n\nWe’re Yonas & Daniel - Co-founders of [StarSling](https://www.starsling.dev).\n\nStarSling (https://starsling.dev) is a developer portal that turns your daily unplanned work from all your dev tools into one-click actions, powered by AI. Open your homepage, click on a GitHub, Linear, or Sentry issue and you’ll see an Autofix button that triggers an agent and opens a Pull Request with a fix, all without leaving your portal. It’s AI agents for the tasks that live outside of your code editor, across deployments, performance, incidents, and bugs.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-rbrSNyguHY \n\n**🌄 Our Story**\n\nDaniel led an engineering team at Netflix that built their Internal Developer Portal (IDP), called Netflix Console. It was the central hub for Netflix's 3,000+ engineers, managers and leaders and became the highest DAU internal tool for developers at Netflix.\n\nYonas built StackShare, one of the largest online developer communities that had over 1.5M registered developers and an enterprise offering used by thousands of companies that integrated tech stack data into their IDPs and other internal tools.\n\nBoth of us have seen the challenges that developers at large companies face in keeping their tech stacks healthy across thousands of codebases. We’ve also seen the benefits that a high-quality single IDP brings to engineering teams. We believe that AI agents have created a unique opportunity for developers to get the benefits of an IDP with automation baked in from the start.\n\n**🔥 The Problem**\n\nDevelopers typically spend \\~20% of their time on annoying eng tasks outside of their code editor:\n\n* Fixing exceptions\n* Patching flaky CI builds and tests\n* Updating engineering docs and changelogs\n* Investigating and remediating incidents\n* Optimizing slow database queries\n* Debugging preview and staging environments\n* Rotating expiring credentials and keys\n\nThese tasks are spread out across many different developer tools and workflows: Sentry, GitHub, CircleCI, PagerDuty, Supabase, Vercel and many more. StarSling is unifying these tools and bringing AI agents to the rest of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).\\\n**🧯 Our Solution**\n\nWe're building a system of AI agents that perform engineering tasks using the deep context that only exists in an internal developer portal (IDP). One central command center that houses internal services, applications, APIs, documentation and has AI agents continuously improving them. We bring your tools into one system and give you powerful workflows by orchestrating AI agents across these tools.\n\nOur first offering is an agentic developer homepage that shows you your aggregated task list along with actions that AIs can take on your behalf. In your homepage you’ll see: your open PRs, exceptions, tickets, notifications, and more alongside AI agents.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90469&key=user_uploads/7866/d4f9f3c3-e7b9-485b-9920-3d04e80d385f)\n\nSoon StarSling will orchestrate agents across the more complex tasks like investigating incidents. Our immediate goal is to be the interface and “portal” to all the AI agents for the dev tools you already use.\n\n**🔮 Our Vision**\n\nTo create a system of AI agents that allows every engineer to spend close to 0% of their time dealing with deployments, performance, incidents, and bugs.\n\n**👇 Our Ask**\n\nIf you’re a developer working on a production system, we’d love to show you StarSling and get your feedback!\n\n👉 Signup for the waitlist: https://starsling.dev\n\n📧 Email us: [founders@starsling.dev](mailto:founders@starsling.dev)",

We're thrilled to share what we've been building, **AI that lives where you already chat, no downloads needed**.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n# **💡 What is **[**text.ai**](https://text.ai)**?**\n\nWe've brought AI directly into SMS (US & CA for now), WhatsApp (worldwide), and Telegram (worldwide) which over 5.5 billion people use daily.\n\nNo new apps to download, no learning curve, just text and go.\n\nWatch our YouTube product video:\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFOBlc6extw>\n\nWe also just made the top 5 on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/text-ai) this past week! \n\n# **✅ How to try it:**\n\n1\\. Save our contact card: \\[[text.ai](http://text.ai)\\]\n\n2\\. Text directly or add to your group chats\n\n3\\. That's it! Works on \\[[SMS](https://www.text.ai/)\\], \\[[WhatsApp](https://wa.me/15626840069?text=What%20is%20the%20best%20Hawaiian%20city%20to%20visit%20for%20Spring%20Break%3F)\\], | \\[[Telegram](https://t.me/thetextai_bot)\\]\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=89968&key=user_uploads/310607/11b0f146-9cef-4d39-9e68-63318cc9299f)\n\n# \n\n**🤔 Why did we build this?**\n\nEver tried explaining to your mom how to download and use a new AI app? Yeah... that's why we built [text.ai](http://text.ai).\n\nI built the first version just for fun, a personal travel companion for when I was hunting for hidden veggie restaurants on my first solo trip to Spain & Portugal (I'm vegetarian) and had no internet. It was ridiculously simple but solved a real problem for me.\n\nThen something unexpected happened. Friends started adding our AI to their group chats. They used it to plan Vegas trips, settle restaurant debates, and even as a digital wingman for date nights.\n\nThe magic? No one had to download a thing. AI just showed up where they already were. In their messages.\n\nNow we're obsessed with one mission: making AI accessible to everyone.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=89968&key=user_uploads/310607/2bf7fa71-528a-4991-9028-ee07c428c527)\n\n# \n\n**🚀 Real magic happens in groups**\n\n\"TextAI saved our Friday night! Eight people with different diets, and it found this amazing Thai fusion place everyone loved. Even suggested dishes for our vegetarian friend. Now it's our go-to for plans!\" - Jackie\n\nNo more endless screenshots. No more one person having to take charge. And finally, a solution for that friend who says \"I'm okay with anything\" and then rejects every suggestion!\n\nWe help your group actually make decisions instead of just talking about them.\n\nOr you can use it to roast them.\n\nEither way it works well.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=89968&key=user_uploads/310607/0441afac-10f3-4c9a-85de-e6d04f843e7c)\n\n**👥 The team behind the magic**\n\nFounded by myself ( [@rushishah](https://www.producthunt.com/@rushishah) , ex-Tesla), [@praharpatel](https://www.producthunt.com/@praharpatel) (Ex-Walmart Labs, Eventbrite, Opentable), and [@maniar](https://www.producthunt.com/@maniar) (ex-Gannett Media, McKinsey).\n\nWe're three friends who've been building products together since college. We're building [text.ai](http://text.ai) because we've experienced firsthand how technology that's meant to connect people often ends up creating more friction instead.\n\nWe believe AI should fit into your life, not the other way around.\n\n# **🔮 What's next?**\n\nWe're working towards going from just answers to action.\n\nSoon, from that same group chat, you'll be able to book a restaurant reservation directly without ever leaving the conversation, get group reminders, book each other's calendars, and even purchase items together.\n\n# \n\n**🙏 We'd love to hear from you**:\n\n* What is the first thing you’d ask [text.ai](http://text.ai)?\n* What group chat would you add [text.ai](http://text.ai) to first?\n* Which feature would make this indispensable for you?\n* Who in your life would find this most helpful?\n\n👉 Try it now: \\[[WhatsApp](https://wa.me/15626840069?text=What%20is%20the%20best%20Hawaiian%20city%20to%20visit%20for%20Spring%20Break%3F)\\] | \\[[Telegram](https://t.me/thetextai_bot)\\] | \\[[SMS](https://www.text.ai/)(Only US & CA for now)\\]",

        "body": "### **TL;DR:** **Please give us your most complicated coding problem that _needs_ to be correct. [Sign up!](https://theoremlabs.com/waitlist/)**\n\nHello World! We’re [Jason](https://jasongross.github.io/) and [Rajashree](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=41ZE3NwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)! We think AI code generation is going to be bigger than any of us can imagine.\n\n### **MISSION**\n\nTheorem is an AI and programming languages research lab. Our question: as the models get better at generating code, what is the bottleneck to safely deploying vastly more computation in the world? \n\n* _Code has bugs._  AI-enabled attackers will increase the volume and velocity of attacks on software infrastructure. Human code review will not scale.\n* _AIs are untrusted generators._ In order to deploy AIs in critical systems without fully understanding their generalization behavior, we’ll need robust, scalable methods for overseeing their solutions.\n\n### **OPPORTUNITY**\n\nProgramming languages and formal methods is the promise that we can bootstrap roots of trust. Even as complexity of software goes up, we can design simple interfaces for steering with leverage.\n\nPreviously, this technology was only applied to the most mission-critical infrastructure, because of the enormous labor bottleneck — requiring years of PhD level engineering work. For instance, Jason worked on the project that wrote the code generator powering trillions of secure https connections everyday, but it took fifteen man-years to complete!\n\nWith advances in AI, we’re able to speed this development cycle 10,000 times! As a [wild example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9nKMjjb3Hg) of what’s possible, we spent two hours finding what would have been a zero-day in https code from 2011.\n\n### **OUR APPROACH**\n\nWe want to build workflows for trustworthy-by-default programming by pushing our best ideas till they break. The current candidate to beat is _program equivalence_ driven development. You oversee a simple reference implementation. We give you an optimized implementation, along with a proof that the programs are functionally equivalent. \n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90592&key=user_uploads/2206829/f5c671df-ac60-4b94-8081-36ae8c0aeda4)\n\nWe’re gradually rolling out our programming environment and models. Some use cases from our customers:\n\n* Performance optimization: finding edge cases where hyper-optimized GPU code would fail; getting clear documentation of dependencies that modify behavior in unforeseen ways. \n* Code migration: automating legacy code refactors from Python to Rust while proving no functional change; writing custom kernels to support new services.\n\n**If you work in public infrastructure, finance, hardware, or have other use cases that demand correctness, we’d love to help.

Currently, many firms rely on manual review steps where engineers literally receive emails containing data they need to review. sieve replaces that with an API that integrates directly into their existing data pipelines. Instead of raising for human review, they can send all the same information to our API and get clean, trustworthy data back. On top of our API, we offer an Excel integration that lets analysts pull data from any source (filings, pdfs, images - even ones in other languages!) into their models with with just a URL.\r\n\r\nAnalysts and data scientists complain that AI alone falls short of their accuracy requirements. They end up needing to check AI outputs against source documents to confirm accuracy.

        "body": "**The problem**\n\nRight now, the most sophisticated hedge funds pay over-qualified data engineers to spend hours a day on the under-levered task of data cleaning. It's crazy to anyone outside of the industry, but in finance even earnings dates (the date a company reports earnings) are considered **a known hard problem.**\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V-OpzDRge3o\n\n**Our ask**\n\nWe've solved this problem and our ask to the YC community is - **connect us with anyone you know who works in the investing world and uses data (should be all of them).** You can email us at [founders@usesieve.com](mailto:nicole@usesieve.com).\n\n**Who we are**\n\nAfter studying CS at MIT, I worked at Citadel and McKinsey, and Savannah worked at Bain. We've dealt with this problem first hand and were amazed that there weren't good solutions.\n\n**What we've built**\n\nsieve lets hedge funds replace manual review in their data pipelines with a simple API call, so their engineers and analysts can get back to more differentiated work. Behind the scenes, we use AI to find and retrieve the appropriate source documents and to extract the requested data. Each data point is reviewed by a team of expert reviewers before being returned to the client. This lets us achieve the level of accuracy hedge funds need, and that AI-only approaches aren't able to achieve.\n\nWe offer direct API access and access via other tools like Excel. Watch below to see how the excel integration works!\n\n[**https://youtu.be/r6A1t_X2kZo**](https://youtu.be/r6A1t_X2kZo)\n\n**What the early results look like**\n\n* sieve is able to replace manual data cleaning workflows:\n  * accurately (100% match to data that was hand-collected internally)\n  * more scalably (weeks of full-time work to review data became a passive background task for the data scientist)\n  * more cheaply (easily 60-70% cheaper than existing options, even when that existing option is BPO outsourcing)\n\nIn our first week of YC, we were told that we need to be at least one of: better, faster, or cheaper.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90521&key=user_uploads/1591478/5e3dcc39-e2cb-48d4-bf91-5babfba2d701)\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90521&key=user_uploads/1591478/9bec35c3-4989-4973-b5ab-2fd181799d39)\n\n",

        "body": "**TLDR:** Blueshoe is the legal back office on autopilot. Our AI agents make billing work disappear – reviewing every invoice, streamlining collections, and providing financial intelligence for modern law firms.\n\nWe’re working with law firms across the U.S. and managing millions in legal revenue.\n\nLearn more at [blueshoe.com](http://blueshoe.com) or email us at [founders@blueshoe.com](mailto:founders@blueshoe.com).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UeV88E3K4iI\n\n**Problem**\n\nLaw firms and their clients are hobbled by outdated back office operations—unclear time entries, delayed invoicing, rejected bills, and rigid pricing models. In the U.S. alone, these inefficiencies tie up over $100 billion in law firm revenue at any given time.\n\nBacklogs persist because of outdated, manual workflows — delayed invoice reviews, fragmented financial data, and no visibility into operational performance across the firm.\n\n**Solution**\n\nBlueshoe transforms billing from an administrative burden into a strategic asset. Our AI agents review invoices in real-time, resolve compliance issues, and provide profitability insights across matters, clients, and practices.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90625&key=user_uploads/1499064/16ecb3c9-3f98-4052-8fbd-ef72a80b4178)\n\nThis isn’t just about speed or automation—it’s about predictability, transparency, and trust. With Blueshoe, firms gain the financial clarity to price work intelligently, forecast revenue reliably, and demonstrate value accurately to clients.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe66zAcMnQd6CVTwSd0uV7TEDqGKXIvrar-yD76RJxJ58Pxb9-P3G2CWRq4co1eeRhth422JLf5CaAbeB1yRwIiIUyARj15yKAjKHyQ_X2ppgGitlcIjYZ6jbb3D8n40lNLI6Crvw?key=GM--uq32ZhXFCCMte1NCRI-9)\n\nWe’re live, onboarding U.S.-based firms, and already managing millions in law firm revenue. Our clients report faster billing cycles, fewer rejections, and a better understanding of their practice.\n\n**About Us**\n\n[Casey O’Grady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-og) went from Harvard Law to strategy consulting to building Blueshoe after seeing firsthand how much back-office chaos holds back the practice of law.\n\n[Kai Yee Wan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kywan/) went from Google to grad school in computer science to spending his days buried in model outputs so that Blueshoe gets smarter with every task.\n\n**Our Ask**\\\nIf you know any law firm managing partners, innovation officers, or legal ops professionals, drop us a note at [founders@blueshoe.com](mailto:founders@blueshoe.com).\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90625&key=user_uploads/1997200/4ecdf8b6-ceab-4e71-93be-d678f7a848de)\n\n",

Our ground station network and integrated software tools work together to maximize uptime and availability, while reducing spacecraft iteration cycles from weeks to hours. \n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90423&key=user_uploads/222992/7b3a56ce-8dc0-48db-a2e5-3badb2afd893)\n\n**Why are we building this and why now?**\n\nThe Deep Space Network (DSN), NASA’s global network of ground terminals for communicating with deep space probes, is [oversubscribed by 40% and in desperate need of upgrades.](https://newspaceeconomy.ca/2024/09/02/nasas-deep-space-network-challenges-and-the-road-ahead/) The DSN is all but unavailable for most commercial operations. Companies with missions going to the Moon and beyond have to deal with a patchwork of individual dish operators for every mission, each with bespoke hardware, specs, and interfaces. Furthermore, many of these commercial providers are not able to handle the demand and [operational failures also can lead to loss of mission](https://www.astroforge.com/updates-collection/odint-mission-debrief).\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90423&key=user_uploads/222992/c6aa8968-e567-42e5-8866-866414630f22)\n\n**Comms system design is fraught with peril**\n\nThe spacecraft comms system design is tightly coupled to the available ground network. Engineers spend hundreds of hours poring over datasheets, on the phone with vendors and suppliers, and endless email threads, only to put all this data into a giant spreadsheet to make sense of it. Every iteration requires not only painful attention to detail, but also in-depth esoteric knowledge of how radio frequency systems and channel coding schemes work in order to accurately predict in-flight performance. Simple misunderstandings can lead to catastrophic errors in design and configuration.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90423&key=user_uploads/222992/1623d16f-4789-4793-892f-2c7adffc84a7)\n\n**End-to-end comms system validation often doesn’t happen**\n\nFully integrated testing between the spacecraft and ground terminal is typically cost prohibitive. Instead, engineers compare spec sheets and email configurations to the ground operators, and hope it works in flight (spoiler alert: it often doesn’t). It is routine for spacecraft to fly having never done an end-to-end test of their system with ground terminal representative hardware. The whole process is subject to human error from end to end. \n\n**This approach to space communications does not scale**\n\nCommercial space ventures beyond low earth orbit have already pushed existing infrastructure to its breaking point, and demand for deep space comms support is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade. We will not have a spacefaring future for humanity until communications for spacecraft become as easy as signing up for cable internet. \n\n**We are redefining the process, starting with spacecraft design**\n\nBetter comms starts at the beginning, in the early trade study and design phase. We are replacing industry-standard spreadsheets with a modern software tool that lets you see how your system will perform with our ground network in real time.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90423&key=user_uploads/222992/4873c5a0-9288-48fe-8d2e-a3a32f3fcad0)\n\n**Test as you fly, fly as you test**\n\nYou don’t rise to the level of your expectations, you fall to the level of your testing. We ship you a “ground station in a box,” identical to hardware we’ve installed at the ground stations you will be using, and provide you with a test plan that you can use to test your entire system end to end, with both the space vehicle and the ground terminal in the loop. \n\n**Launch with confidence**\n\nFly and operate your spacecraft. Use our API to schedule passes on our network, track your spacecraft, stream data, monitor the ground site, and access recordings.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90423&key=user_uploads/222992/2b01ca98-b6d7-4f8b-9af5-5b93b0613ef0)\n\n**We are rolling out our preliminary network rapidly**\n\nWe start by partnering with owners of dishes that are currently unused for any other telemetry applications. This allows us to build out the product and acquire customers with a minimal amount of capital. As we build out the network, we will further expand our network by strategically building our own ground stations in key locations. Our first downlink only ground stations are expected to come online in 2025, with more to follow in 2026.\n\n**We are passionate about your mission success**\n\n[Jacob](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/company/30556) and [Arlen](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/user/2222230) have solved many of these exact problems at company level scales in previous roles. Jacob was RF system architect at SpaceX and Arlen has built complex hardware/software systems his entire career. Collectively they have spent hundreds of hours in mission control, many of those hours dealing with anomalies and outright failures. They are both passionate about building the culture of excellence at Cascade that is required for flawless mission execution.\n\n**If you are struggling with comms for your upcoming mission, drop us a line. We can help.**\n\nhttps://cascade.space/",

We integrate with EHRs, clearinghouses, and payer portals, helping providers and medical billing firms **recover lost revenue and save significant staff time.**\n\n[Launch Video](https://youtu.be/6AYEhYpMjBQ)\n\n\\\n**🩺 The Problem** \\\nUS healthcare providers lose **$260B+** annually to denied claims, and spend **$20B+** fighting them. Yet **fewer than 15%** of denials are appealed - even though **over 50%** of appeals are successful. With AI-driven denials on the rise, the system is collapsing under its own weight.\n\nThe current process of fighting a denial is manual, time-consuming and riddled with inefficiencies. \\\n\\\n🧠 **The Solution** \\\nAegis plugs into a provider’s existing data stack (EHR, PMS, clearinghouses) to:\n\n* **Detect denials automatically:** Aegis continuously monitors claims data streams from your clearinghouse and instantly flags denied claims without requiring manual intervention. These denied claims are then arranged by priority based on deadline and claim value.\n* **Pull patient records, EOBs, and payor docs:** Aegis integrates with the EHR to fetch supporting materials, such as patient records, Explanation of Benefits (EOBs), and payer correspondence.\n* **Generate and submit appeal packages:** Using AI trained on successful appeal language and payer requirements, Aegis drafts customized appeal letters, compiles required documentation, and submits the appeal directly to the insurance provider via appropriate channels (fax, portal, or clearinghouse).\n* **Track appeal progress and surface denial insights:** Aegis provides end-to-end tracking of every appeal, including submission confirmation, status updates, and final resolution. Over time, it also analyzes patterns in denials- by payer, procedure, provider, and code- to help providers take proactive steps to reduce future denial rates.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90624&key=user_uploads/2684885/a6415c5b-f49e-407a-ae34-dc0f3af6833e)\n\nWe cut the cost of appealing a denial by **80%** and reduce the time to file an appeal from **2+ hours to under 2 minutes**.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90624&key=user_uploads/2684885/65b5d60c-b1ca-4c93-9522-eb4cff454dee)\n\n👥 **Team**\n\nWe’re a team of three close friends from Carnegie Mellon University with deep, complementary expertise across AI, finance, and full-stack development- built for solving complex problems like healthcare claims. Aarav (CS + ML) brings AI research experience and worked at Palantir, where he helped deploy data-driven solutions at scale. Krishang (Econ + Math) did fixed-income risk modeling at one of India’s top funds. Dhanya (IS + CS) is a seasoned full-stack engineer who’s built production systems at three companies. Together, we’re building Aegis to bring automation, intelligence, and trust to healthcare appeals.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90624&key=user_uploads/2684885/14e2b315-9c6c-44df-af7a-9debc2a477ae)\n\n**🙏 How You Can Help** \\\nConnect us to:\n\n* CFOs at hospitals / MSOs\n* Healthcare leaders open to advising\n* Independent practice owners\n* Founders who’ve sold into the RCM stack\n\nPlease shoot us an email at [founders@aegishealth.us](mailto:founders@aegishealth.us).",

        "body": "**Vibe coding is flooding GitHub with leaked secrets.**\n\nAs writing code becomes increasingly accessible, it's easier than ever to accidentally expose API keys, database credentials, SSH private keys, and more.\n\n**TLDR:** BitPatrol detects secret leaks in your source code that traditional scanners miss, helping you prevent costly data breaches.\n\n🎥 **Demo Video:** [Watch here](https://youtu.be/cJwggIj3SZA)\n\n---\n\n### **The Problem**\n\nSecret leaks are happening every day, impacting companies across every industry. Traditional scanning tools attempt to catch these leaks using rigid regex patterns and keyword matching.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90617&key=user_uploads/2475147/274a7869-42fd-41fc-86f4-668846d4d01e)\n\nHowever, these methods struggle with secrets that don't follow set patterns, allowing critical leaks like these to slip through undetected.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90617&key=user_uploads/2475147/e67f96a4-a636-461e-9434-93a92f23f1ff)\n\n### **Our Solution**\n\nUnlike legacy tools that rely on regular expressions, BitPatrol uses our proprietary machine learning model to detect secrets based on code context and developer intent – not just string patterns.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90617&key=user_uploads/2475147/243b128a-4438-4e39-bf3b-7c6c1b8e3d32)\n\nOnce our model flags a potential secret, we reference it against our dataset of billions of public commits, docker images, and open source packages. This helps us rapidly assess the secret's exposure frequency, drastically reducing false positives and solving the issue of alert fatigue.\n\nUsing our [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/bitpatrol), you can trigger actions that occur when a secret is detected, including automated alerts and custom workflows to immediately respond and remediate when a secret is leaked.\n\n### **The Team**\n\nBitPatrol was founded by [Chris Lambert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/~chris), a former Stripe engineer who quickly rose to the top 2% globally on HackerOne after uncovering secret leaks at some of the world’s largest companies—many of which were actively using our competitor’s tools.\n\n### 🙏 **Ask: How You Can Help**\n\n* **Try BitPatrol:** Install our [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/bitpatrol) and experience immediate, real-time secret detection.\n* **Connect with Us:** If you know a technical leader concerned about protecting their company from secret leaks in code, please connect them to [founders@bitpatrol.io](mailto:founders@bitpatrol.io)\n\n### 🔥 **The Deal**\n\nTo celebrate our launch, we’re offering:\n\n* **Free 2024 Company Secret Leak Audits (a $20K value)**\n  * External-only scan — requires no internal data access\n  * Deep, high-coverage audit of your public code surface (commits, mobile apps, etc.)\n  * Request an [audit here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBwBwk9-tizbOo1y3Aj9aK6jXeX8QNKJIhwEFTp0OuvhcNAg/viewform?usp=header)\n* **Exclusive early-adopter pricing**\n  * Just $20/dev/month for real-time secret scanning with our [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/bitpatrol)\n\nDon’t let vibe coding turn into your next major breach—secure your code with BitPatrol today.\n\n👉 [Get started at BitPatrol.io](https://bitpatrol.io/) or reach out directly: [founders@bitpatrol.io](mailto:founders@bitpatrol.io)",

Oftentimes, issues in your product don't make it to a support ticket until dozens of users have experienced it first. Daxa helps you combat this problem by watching users interact directly with your product and notifying you in real time via Slack or email if any issues or interesting phenomenon arise (dropoff on certain pages, features not performing as expected, etc)",

Then we keep those tests in sync with how users actually interact with your product — no more flaky selectors or stale test scripts.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Problem**\n\nE2E tests are a _pain_ to write — and an even bigger pain to maintain.\n\n* Writing Cypress or Playwright tests is time-consuming and brittle\n* Even no-code tools require manually defining flows or relying on flaky CSS selectors\n* Every UI change risks breaking your suite, forcing teams to either spend hours fixing tests or just give up and test manually\n\nMost teams hit the same tradeoff: **move fast and break things** — or slow down to ensure quality.\n\n### **Our Solution**\n\nDocket lets you:\n\n* Write tests in plain English (\"Log in, Search for Y Combinator t shirt, Add 2 shirts to cart\")\n* Skip the brittle selectors — we use multimodal agents that interact with the page like humans\n* Automatically keep tests up to date with real user session data\n\n---\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90473&key=user_uploads/296302/5977d1c3-f564-4d67-b623-319bb6252efd)\n\n### **Meet the Team**\n\nWe’re **Nishant** and **Boris** — two engineers who dreaded writing tests so much, we started a company to fix it.\n\nWe met while working at **AWS**, and between us, we’ve built and shipped products at **Stripe, Citadel, Brex, and Patreon**. But testing was always the drag. Writing tests took forever. Keeping them working was even worse. We constantly felt the pain of choosing between moving fast and having confidence in our code.\n\nSo we’re building the tool we wish we had: **Docket** — tests in plain English that stay up to date, without the maintenance burden.\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90473&key=user_uploads/296302/f2b9cf37-f50c-4c40-8ca9-6a43d5069a0b)\n\n---\n\n### **Launch Offer**\n\nAs part of our launch, we’re offering **free complete test suite implementations** for our next 10 customers. Book a demo [here](https://calendly.com/nishant-docket/docket-intro-meeting)!\n\n\\\n— Nishant & Boris\n\n![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=90473&key=user_uploads/296302/c4bc7ae4-7794-4316-9dce-883ce72a97fc)\n\n",

        "body": "Hey everyone, we’re[ Kevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevindzhang/) and[ Nam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nam-nguyen96/) - cofounders of[ Cohesive](https://getcohesiveai.com/) 👋\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nCohesive helps service business owners take control of their own destiny - our agentic CRM fully manages growth today for over 350 commercial cleaning, landscaping, and pest control owners.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE3ZNisKZoQ\n\n**❌ The Problem**\n\nIf you run a commercial service company (e.g., janitorial, HVAC, landscaping, pest control), you’re probably out in the field quite often visiting clients.\n\nSince you’ll be constantly on the move, most of your growth is dependent on others - outsourced sales talent (like offshore VAs), paid ads (like LSA), or from marketing agencies (like for SEO or lead generation). \n\nThis is the reality for the 1+ million blue-collar businesses in the United States today.\n\n**👷 Our Solution**\n\nOur agentic CRM helps service businesses grow by in-housing growth:\n\n* **Market Research:** building out a list of potential business owners and property owners and their contact information in their service area\n* **Outreach:** automatically reaching out to potential targets to assess interest, and self-updating the CRM accordingly\n* **Monitoring:** constantly monitoring and triggering follow-ups based on active signals (e.g., new location opening or existing contract ending)\n\nIt’s helped our customers so much that one of early clients is buying us NBA floor tickets (albeit for the worst team in the league):\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc1EFN9K8a4exd5YmdWDeo6af4PDp4M_GTp8eqIRZB0pf5nxrh7OWotK1VZQg3QYBjQ7QbclIsSJm5TkIyz6W50FTO_OD01zEGaFOOgM82Jy2nA2iA5Tg13zVXg6gP_FtTUJ2GSGg?key=HJjAgxbnHaeSWRuTHARDMw)\n\n🙏 **Our Ask**\n\n* Follow us on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cohesive-ai)\n* Share this post - do you know anyone running a commercial service business (e.g., did you recently hire a janitor or landscaper? Let them know - they can book a demo [here](https://calendly.com/cohesiveapp/demo)!)\n* Learn more at [getcohesiveai.com](http://getcohesiveai.com)\n\n**👬 The Team**\n\nKevin and Nam have known each other for years (founded a 50K MRR+ service business together before) and co-founded Cohesive in late 2024. \n\nKevin (CEO): Previously led a product at Charthop (a16z-backed HR tech), and was a consultant at McKinsey, where he worked with national service franchises on GTM strategy.
