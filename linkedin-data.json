His work ethic is so strong, it could bench press a Buick, and he goes the extra mile more often than a marathon runner. Speaking of that, given his rotund figure, he should perhaps run one or two!\n\nAyush's quick wit and adaptability are like a chameleon on caffeine, allowing him to navigate any situation with the finesse of a ballet dancer in a minefield. He's the ultimate team player, always ready to lend a hand or a well-timed joke to lighten the mood. Ayush's attention to detail is sharper than a laser-guided scissors, ensuring that no stone is left unturned, no i is left undotted, no t is left uncrossed, and no donut is left unassaulted. He's the epitome of professionalism, with contributions that are more valuable than a truckload of gold-plated chocolates. But he should lay some of those chocolates off, eh?\n\nBut hold your horses, folks, because once Ayush gets started, he's like a runaway train with a rocket strapped to its back. He's a force of nature, a supernova of potential, and a genuine asset to any organization smart enough to snatch him up. So, giddy up and get ready for the ride of your life, because Ayush is about to take you on a one-way trip to success! But that trip is NOT a one-way to fitness!",

At the heart of this cloud are Blaxel Sandboxes, which provide agents with access their own virtual computer(s). They are agentic by design: the entire VM is exposed as a simple MCP server. Your agents can read/write files and run shell commands as simple tool calls. Blaxel sandboxes shut down after 1s of inactivity (and we snapshot the running memory). Upon receiving any request, they boot in less than 25ms and resume the processes state exactly where it was left off. Here's a demo of connecting to a Blaxel sandbox using MCP and making tool calls with a simple LangChain agent. We built the first operating system as-a-service for agents.

Not only did she quickly build collaborative partnerships across the team, but she developed a full prototype that positively impacts quality, time-to-market, and telemetry for new cloud service offerings. Her communication and presentation skills were outstanding throughout the internship, but especially evident in her final report out to approximately 100 engineers and leaders across the division. As she returns to school, she will be missed, but hopefully we will have the opportunity to work together in the future.",

Internally we raised from Founders Fund, Khosla, First Round and other top VCs, achieving a 1B+ valuation at our peak. I joined as our first Software Engineer. Helped prototype, launch, and scale multiple iterations of Forward across software, hardware, and operations. Helped build a national healthcare system through our Flagship sites and CarePods.

This was a highly complex role as the App was not just a graphical UI but managed an array of functionality beneath it, which he was responsible for.\n\nThis included the delivery of games via the App; cyrptocurrency management/rewards for the players and the developers of the games; community tools such as profiles, rewards, friending, social media notifications and more; the \"challenging\" mechanism which allowed players to challenge each other to in-game tournaments and wager crypto, a major task all on its own, a huge list of other many other tasks as well.\n\nFrancesco comes from the classic mould of hugely smart and talented developers who just get on and do the job. A quiet guy but who when he does talk and comment on the tasks, design or overall deliverable you would be very silly not to listen to. He is incredibly insightful and can see issues well before they develop, any PM or Producer not listening to him is setting their project up for future problems.\n\nQuiet he may be but he has a great sense of humour, Italian by birth but with the sarcasm of a born and bred British man. His English is perfect, better than most English people I know. Well respected by his colleagues and able to fit into any team I would think Francesco would be a great asset to any development team looking for someone who gets the job done, brings huge smarts to the table with a quiet confidence of someone who knows they can let their performance and output do the talking for them.

Here's how it happened... I was working closely on content marketing for Cactus (YC X25) with my amazing clients and good friends Ajith Govind Satheesh and Avinash Joshi . I got to know these founders inside and out. Their vision. Their work ethic. How they never gave up. I saw how they prioritized company culture, making sure everyone\u2014from engineers to interns\u2014felt valued and heard. I could see something special. I made a decision that surprised everyone\u2014including myself. I decided to put all of my savings and invest in the company. It went from writing their content to writing them a check. At that time, there was no YC backing. Just pure belief in the founders and what they were building. Then a few months later, Ajith messaged me: \"Umme I have something to share, can you hop on a call?\" My heart was pounding. Good news? Bad news? With founders, you never know. These two got on the call with huge grins on their faces. I paused. What could it possibly be? And then they both shouted: \"WE GOT INTO Y COMBINATOR!\" I was shocked. Not just at the news, but at how they took the time to personally celebrate this moment with me. I wasn't their biggest investor, but these humble founders made me feel like family. If you're a founder who didn't get into YC\u2014maybe you don't need it right now. Maybe you need to believe in your vision enough that others start believing too. Grateful to Ajith Govind Satheesh and Avinash Joshi for this incredible journey. Here's to many more \ud83d\ude80 PS: This shows how seriously we take our clients at Social Narrativ . We don't just work with you, we believe in you and invest our energy into your success. If you need personal branding services, DM \"BRAND\" to join our waitlist. Bookings open June 15th.

The practicum project is an eight-month-long project working with enterprise-level data and enterprise-level problems.\n\nSupreet is ahead of his time when it comes to problem-solving, always being sure to keep a client-focused approach, and having a passion to dive into data. Any time we were in an early or brainstorming phase, you could be sure to find Supreet at the white board. He does such a great job of visualizing and explaining his thought process and explaining the problem. Supreet often made challenging problems very easily digestible - and he enjoyed it too! Additionally, Supreet is the highest level Excel wizard that I have ever met (one of those people that asks, \"Why would you use a mouse?\"). Along with all of these skills, Supreet is extremely proficient in the areas of machine learning and Python.\n\nOne of my favorite things about working with Supreet was his calm nature and ability to act as a mediator. Often when there was a disagreement with the team, Supreet was able to see both sides of the argument and present opposing views in a new light capturing all of the pros and cons of each choice.\n\nI will dearly miss my time with Supreet but hope that our paths will cross again in the future. He is an absolute rock star, and any team would be beyond lucky to have him be a part of it.",

Supreet was a critical factor in the project\u2019s success \u2013 his expertise in Resource Planning Optimization and Analytic Tools allowed us to work efficiently and arrive at a strong recommendation that received the full support of our client.\n\nSupreet demonstrated his expertise in Optimization very quickly, both in the quality of his analyses and in the questions he raised as we discussed the ideal approach. Communication is another strength for Supreet, who conveys ideas clearly in both verbal and written form, and is quick to clarify points before confusion sets in.\n\nSupreet was a dedicated, motivated team member who continually exceeded my expectations on productivity and timelines. Given the urgent nature of the work, this allowed us to focus more energy on a few key questions from our client. This was appreciated and recognized at our client as well as internally, and led to a result we were all proud of.\n\nI would recommend Supreet to anyone looking for a strong, capable teammate who is dedicated to solving challenging problems in a cooperative fashion, while having a bit of fun along the way.",

Not to sell. Just to share what agentic delivery makes possible. We met someone there who had lived the same pain\u2014 And out of pure generosity, they shared our story on LinkedIn. No ask. No prompt. Just support. From that post, someone else reached out. One of the most forward-thinking implementation leaders we\u2019ve met. We had a call. We showed the product. And just like that\u2014signed an $84K annual contract. Not because of a clever pitch. But because the pain was real, and the solution finally made sense. It sounds impossible. But zoom out, and it\u2019s actually simple: \ud83d\udc49 Build something people want. \ud83d\udc49 Talk to people who\u2019ve felt the pain. \ud83d\udc49 Let the right conversations unfold.

Because if we can\u2019t crawl it, neither can an LLM. And if an LLM can\u2019t access it, it can\u2019t reason about it, personalize it, or generate anything useful from it. What can you do about it: Regularly test your website for crawl-ability, scrap-ability, and use of JSON-LD schemas! A combination of Google, screaming frog, and any scrapability test software would do the trick. Your knowledge base shouldn\u2019t be a locked filing cabinet. If users (or AI) can\u2019t find the right answer, it doesn\u2019t exist!",

No more spending loads of time doing EDA, data cleaning, and trial and error writing the best models. Our AI is different from other tools since we engineered it to understand your data. Therefore it knows the best code to write for your data, where other tools are error prone since they don't understand the underlying nature of your data often times providing arbitrary code that requires your intervention. Spend less time writing boilerplate code, and more time delivering insights - we even automate report generation!

He has a wise head on his shoulders, doesn't get frustrated easily and gives his best to achieve the tasks assigned to him. Waleed is keen to share his ideas, and can easily carry a discussion.\n\nWaleed was primarily working on Angular and AngularJS during his internship. He rapidly got the initial learning out of the way and became a regular contributor to our codebase. I was impressed by how quickly he was able to grasp the relatively harder Angular concepts like templates, containers and directives.\n\nI wish Waleed the best for his Academic pursuits and would love to work with him again.",

    "summary": "We built the World's First AI Agent for Teachers. It's used by professors and TA's at University of California, Riverside and Holmes Community College . And now, it works in Canvas LMS . Teachers have fallen in love with the way we integrate so seamlessly into their grading process in Google Classroom and Docs. But to be honest, our Canvas integration still sucked. It got the job done for overall feedback, but what students need in order to actually improve, is pinpointed, specific annotations on sections of their work. That's why today, we're announcing Smart Annotations in Canvas. If you're a college professor, teaching assistant, or just happen to use the Canvas LMS at your school, we think you'll love this. VibeGrade (YC X25) is the only grading tool that actually: 1. Saves the teacher time 2. Increases scores by delivering better, actionable feedback 3. Works directly in your existing platform, like Canvas or Classroom. Teachers and students love it. If you're a school that wants to: 1. Improve teacher quality of life 2. Help students improve 3. Be at the cutting edge of AI for education You'd be failing our education system by not giving it a try. This is just the beginning. We'd love to partner with your school to make education better for everyone.",

    "summary": "Sales leadership is often times a thankless game. You're charged with hitting the numbers, if you don't, you're gone. If you do - numbers go up, good job. You can help people grow in their careers, you can help them make more $$$ than they've ever made before. But if something changes, ooh they can turn on you fast. Market gets tougher. Company pivots/makes some changes. Selling get a bit harder. All that good will can go quickly. People love you when things are good. People hate you when things are bad/hard. Naval Ravikant said it so well 'In leadership you are often times just ONE decision away from mutiny' Your goal as a leader is ver simple in my mind. 'Make your people better and help them accomplish more than they coud on their own' Not everyone is going to like you. Not everyone is going to be your friend. But if each and every day you're striving to help make them better and achieve more? That's all you can do. Those that understand it and appreciate, those are your people. Those that just want the world without being willing to give/grow/adapt/change/invest, you can't win them over anyway. But keep going ya'll. Keep pushing. Keep GROWING as a leader, and it will pay off in the long run.",

Rohan already had experience in iOS, but looked for additional help to update his app, Zipshare. When I first looked at the source code, I was amazed at what he had accomplished with both Swift and Firebase. I see that Rohan would be a great iOS engineer in any team.",

        "text": "I am writing to give my full recommendation for Jeevesh Konuru. I\u2019m a Senior Manufacturing Engineer at Lockheed Martin and I worked directly with Jeevesh during his internship at Lockheed Martin in the Summer of 2018. His determination, creativity, and problem solving skills were tremendous, and Jeevesh was more than eager to help our team determine and enact solutions to address repetitive manufacturing defects. During my time working with him, I assigned him one of the projects which I was working on with the objective of greatly reducing repetitive failures on the aircraft. The particular component of the aircraft which Jeevesh worked on was one of the top defect drivers for the year, and his work identifying the root cause, and defining an appropriate corrective action in the short amount of time he had greatly exceeded my expectations. Jeevesh hit the ground running, almost as if he had been doing it for years. He wasted no time, immediately speaking with Mechanics and Supervisors on the manufacturing floor, other Manufacturing Engineers, and Design Engineers to learn more about the process, and determine all possible root causes. Jeevesh\u2019s ability to collect, interpret, and present both qualitative and quantitative data about the components under investigation allowed him to differentiate potential root causes from non contributing factors, and share knowledge with other Manufacturing Engineers so that they could look for the same defects occurring elsewhere. I know that he spent many late nights and early mornings learning Engineering specifications, advanced metrology techniques, and observing processes which only happened during second or third shift. On more than one occasion I personally asked Jeevesh if he could come in on a weekend to help with something and he agreed without hesitation. One trait about Jeevesh which stuck out to me more than anything was how much he enjoyed his work, and learning new things. This eagerness to learn, to work with other team members, and to help solve problems is why he was so successful during his time with Lockheed Martin. His root cause analysis was incredibly thorough, identifying and investigating multiple root causes, and determining their possible effects on the outcome of the part. The corrective action plan which Jeevesh coordinated and implemented to address the high impact root causes which he identified will make a substantial improvement to the component he set out to fix. Jeevesh\u2019s dedication, creativity, problem solving ability, and personable attitude will make him a valuable asset to any organization or group which he is a part of. I have no doubts that these traits will serve him well throughout his career and allow him to succeed at anything he attempts. His work as part of our Manufacturing Engineering team at Lockheed Martin was invaluable, and I wish we could have had him as part of the team for longer.",

    "summary": "\ud83d\ude80 Hello, Automated Nanoindentation! I\u2019m excited to share a major leap in how we probe the mechanical behavior of materials: automated nanoindentation. \ud83d\udd2c Why nanoindentation? It\u2019s one of the most important tools for mapping hardness, elastic modulus, creep, and excavation resistance at the nanoscale. By pressing a diamond tip into a surface and recording load-displacement curves, we can extract precise information about how a material deforms - down to individual grains, phases, or thin films. \u26a1 The inefficiency of grid-based tests. Traditionally, we raster a grid of indents across a sample. But what if you only care about a specific microstructural feature\u2014say, a precipitate, a grain boundary, or an inclusion? Or if you want to sweep through a combinatorial library to see how composition affects hardness? And when you need to correlate indentation data with EDX maps or EBSD grain\u2010orientation information, a uniform grid wastes time and data. \ud83d\ude80 Our automated solution At UTK, Vivek Chawla and Stephen Puplampu have taken the same autonomous workflows we pioneered for STEM and SPM\u2014and extended them to nanoindentation. We now have: - Real-time image analytics to identify features of interest (grains, interfaces, phases) on the fly. - Deep kernel learning models that predict which indent locations will yield the richest insight. - And are exploring combinatorial exploration routines that seamlessly integrate indentation, EDX, and EBSD, so you get multi-modal maps in a fraction of the time. \ud83c\udfa5 In this short video, Vivek Chawla and Stephen Puplampu walk through our system in action\u2014showing how automated nanoindentation can transform your mechanical characterization workflows. And this is done *without* any specific API - so you can too! Special thanks to National Science Foundation (NSF) MRSEC Center UT Center for Advanced Materials & Manufacturing (CAMM) for supporting this work and building the connection between machine learning and physical tools for materials discovery! Check it out and let us know what you think!",

While we were both students at Niles West High School, I was in charge of managing the student helpdesk, and Anguel was my right hand man. We worked on a number of projects together; one of which was creating extensive documentation for other students, but we did it via how-to videos, and they were published to the helpdesk website. These were pretty unique and Anguel quickly was able to learn the ins and outs of Corel and Sony Vegas, our video editing software of choice, as a result. It was a pleasure working with Anguel at the helpdesk. When I left the helpdesk, I was confident that the management position was in good hands with Anguel.",

We handle all the technical setup, diversify email infrastructure and regularly check and test deliverability\n3. We craft concise, prospect-focused messaging that feels personal and relevant\n\nAnd through this process we have helped our clients achieve results like:\n\n\u2705 Imnoo (manufacturing software) consistently booking 5 sales calls every week\n\u2705 Santillana (leading education platform) achieve an 84% positive reply rate\n\u2705 Pycad (medical software) get 15 hours back on their outbound\n\nIf you\u2019d like to achieve similar results from your outbound then you have 2 options\u2026\n\n1.

PLG is too competitive and crowded, there\u2019s no chance to differentiate. Good people telling stories on demos will scale faster. - Last time: Junior people were hired to take up responsibility. - This time: Senior people with GPT = no need for as many junior people. - Last time: Back then news articles were king. Getting cited in the WSJ changed your month. - This time: Getting into mass media doesn\u2019t matter. Going viral on LinkedIn can make your quarter. - Last time: Back then, it was a given that contracts were annual. - This time: Now, way more people expect monthly contracts as a default. You have to make the strong case for annual. And, you have to constantly fight to keep the customer. You can\u2019t take them for granted. - Last time: A good idea with mediocre talent was enough. You could build a moat and sustain it for a while. - This time: Today, it\u2019s too easy to build products and people will catch up unless you have good people constantly seeking the edge.",

In all of my interactions with him, I have found him to be the epitome of generosity and dedication. Indeed, it is without hesitation that Land's is one of the most kind-hearted and committed individuals I have had the good fortune to encounter throughout my academic journey. Together, we embarked on various assignments, encompassing elaborate projects and regular homework tasks. We also joined forces to prepare for examinations. During these academic pursuits, one characteristic of Land's consistently stood out - his remarkable calm under pressure. Despite our work's rigorous and demanding nature, I cannot recall a single instance when Land succumbed to stress. His resilience is underpinned by an exceptional work ethic; he persistently pursues his goals, demonstrating a steadfast determination to see each task through to completion. One of our most challenging projects required us to delve into the intricacies of programming and mathematical modeling. This was a demanding endeavor, testing our academic abilities to their limits. However, a twist of fate had Land return to Thailand in the midst of this task to attend to some personal formalities. Despite the physical distance and the distractions of his circumstances, Land remained an integral part of our team. Unyielding in his commitment, he worked relentlessly, contributing significantly to our project from across the globe. His effort exemplified his dedication to his work and his ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, an essential attribute in today's ever-changing world. Land's contribution was the lynchpin for the successful completion of many of our academic undertakings. His reliability, exceptional technical aptitude, and unfaltering dedication were instrumental in facilitating our achievements. Land was the cornerstone, the steady force that propelled us forward in the face of adversity and uncertainty. Furthermore, I would say Land is a remarkable individual who has made a lasting impact during my time in graduate school. His warmth, dedication, and relentless pursuit of excellence are qualities that are not only rare but also highly desirable in any professional setting. I have no doubt that Land will bring the same degree of commitment, skill, and positive attitude to any future endeavor he undertakes.",

    "summary": "Shoutout to the unsung heroes behind Google I/O 2025 - the engineers whose work doesn\u2019t make it to the keynote reel but without whom the show wouldn\u2019t happen. The AI breakthroughs and slick product demos may steal the spotlight, but behind the scenes are countless hours of debugging, internal reviews, and complex tooling gymnastics. I know because I\u2019ve been there. During my 5.5 years at Google, across 3 different teams at Android XR, Quick Share and Stadia, I worked behind the curtain - fixing last-minute issues, unblocking partner teams, and enabling those magical on-stage moments you see once a year. I earned 5 spot bonuses and 14 peer bonuses along the way, not because of flashy work, but because I helped make things work. On deadline. Sometimes into the night. Under intense scrutiny. And always knowing that if we did our jobs right, no one would notice. That experience of living inside Google\u2019s release infrastructure, and seeing the real cost of getting high-quality software into users\u2019 hands became the spark that led me to build QualGent (YC X25) . Because great engineers shouldn\u2019t have to fight flaky tests, incomplete QA coverage, or guess whether their release will hold up in the wild. So this post is a thank you - to every engineer staying late to get a build out, writing one more test, fixing one more bug so the next moonshot can fly. You\u2019re the reason I/O is a success. And you\u2019re the reason I started QualGent. #GoogleIO #Engineering #QualGent #ThankYou #SoftwareQuality #BehindTheScenes #DevTools #StartupStory",

The bulk of my time was spent on a project working with electrochemical materials, artificial solid-electrolyte interfaces and Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition technology to drive up the stability of Li-ion batteries. I took the initiative to increase the efficiency of my laboratory, including introducing MATLAB code to rapidly compile and analyze data in place of using Excel, which would crash from simply loading the data files.\n\nI spent time compiling global data on EV and battery technology to extract trends, followed by making them easily consumable, for the purposes of industrial planning.\nFinally, I compiled and organized large number of patents, to produce information on where the technology of the industry was going and make further predictions."

However, it has been shown that the SEI (solid-electrolyte interface) formed is unstable and is reformed with each cycle, reducing stability and use. Using Sn single crystals, I determined first that the (100) and (001) planes were differently stable, and second that the absence of oxygen or an oxide layer made the planes equally stable.\n\nI also took the initiative to increase the safety and efficiency of equipment in the laboratory, including redesigning several electrochemical cells to increase ease of assembly and safety. They now require less Lithium metal and LiPF6, both of which are safety hazards when the cells must be removed from the glove box, and are expensive to boot."

The Booth brothers, James Booth and Max Booth are both Oxford math grads, have tutored for a decade, and are set on making human-quality AI tutors a reality. Throughout their education, they experienced firsthand the stark difference between active, exploratory learning\u2014 which significantly accelerated their understanding\u2014 and passive lecture-based methods, which often proved ineffective. Chiron is built on the principle that AI tutors can only achieve human-quality effectiveness when actively engaged with the student's thought process. To achieve this, the app uses symbolic logic to validate math handwriting instantly, providing direct, actionable feedback in real-time.",

    "summary": "Chestnut is building the first AI mortgage lender, with AI agents that save customers 0.5%+ in interest. Founder Spencer Brown previously built a mortgage Loan Origination System that powered $85B+ in mortgage volume (1-2% of US mortgages annually). In the process, he saw firsthand how 80% of employees at traditional lenders spend hours each day filling out paper forms, manually reviewing documents, and copy-pasting data between systems. These manual processes cost lenders \u2013 and ultimately their borrowers \u2013 $12,000+ per loan ($61B+ per year). AI can automate 99% of mortgage operations, and Chestnut is setting out to do just that. Besides Ashley, the AI loan officer assistant, Chestnut's agents also help clients find their best mortgage option, cut borrowing costs with automated origination, and notify clients when rates drop. Chestnut is currently licensed in Texas and Colorado, helping clients with home purchases, refinances, cash-outs, and home equity lines of credit. Congrats on the launch, Spencer! \ud83d\ude80 https://lnkd.in/dwW9HRYn",

    "summary": "I work strategically as an area tech lead for a team of 45+ engineers in Youtube. Previously I've built core payments backend for Google Pay India app. My ultra-fast growth as an engineer (staff engineer in 6 years) has been fueled by my passion for building products, finding the right problems to solve, and investing in my leadership skills. I give back to the broad software engineering community through 1:1 mentorships, newsletters, and educational content creation on LinkedIn and TikTok.\n\nI previously had a deep interest in competitive programming. During college, I proved myself as up to the ultimate challenge by qualifying for ACM-ICPC world finals, aka olympics of programming. In addition, I also invested in uplifting Indian competitive programmers\u2014hosting specialized training camps, coaching the Indian team for IOI (ioinformatics.org), simplifying complex concepts via tutorials, hosting various programming contests as a judge. I still reap the benefits of the programming and collaboration skills I learnt during that time.",

Think Jarvis for Ironman. We want to empower small business owners and solo entrepreneurs to succeed.\n\nI've always wanted to build a product-first company that uses dead simple tech to solve a large problem. We're looking for our early founding team members who are passionate about programming, heads-down builders, and excited to create a generational company.\n\nMy fascination with technology began at a young age, and over the years, I've honed my skills across various programming languages and frameworks, including PHP, Python, Django, React, Angular, and Rails.\n\nI lead with empathy and transparency, striving to create a culture that values compassion and open communication. Inspired by companies like Basecamp, PostHog, and GitLab, I am passionate about building products that genuinely improve people's lives without unnecessary complexity.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, engaging in deep conversations, and spending quality time with my family. My guiding principle in both work and life is simple: \"It\u2019s Possible.\"",

Avinash is not only a brilliant technical builder but also an incredible person on a personal level.\n\nAt university, Avinash founded the Open Source club, mentoring over 100 students and driving major open source contributions. His leadership and passion for technology were evident from the start, and they have only grown stronger over the years.\n\nOne of the stories that stand out about Avinash is when he won the Sun Microsystems coding contest. Instead of taking the all-inclusive travel package for himself, he negotiated with Sun to exchange it for train tickets for his entire team of 11. This selfless act allowed his team to celebrate together and demonstrated his incredible ability to think outside the box and prioritize his team\u2019s happiness. He inspired an entire batch of students to get into coding contests.\n\nTechnically, Avinash is a force to be reckoned with. He made significant contributions to the OpenSolaris codebase and built DefinedTerm, a platform that helps lawyers write more clearly and accurately. His work has earned him accolades, including winning the Code For Freedom contest and publishing an IEEE paper on cybersecurity knowledge empowerment.\n\nHaving known Avinash for 17 years, from our college days to our professional collaboration at Turing, I can confidently say that he is one of the most talented and dedicated individuals I have ever met. At Turing Labs, he played a pivotal role in retaining and expanding major CPG logos, delivering over $57M in business impact to R&D teams.\n\nBeyond his technical skills, Avinash is an amazing person who exudes positivity. He firmly believes that with the right mindset and effort, anything is possible. His positive attitude and unwavering commitment make him an exceptional leader and an even better friend. Working with Avinash has been an absolute joy, and I am incredibly excited about our future endeavours together.",

SchoolOS as it is called was successful due to significant contributions from Avinash.\n- I have personally witnessed Avinash's organization skills during FOSSTER '09, an open source event organized by his college.

A month earlier, my cofounder had a life-threatening allergic reaction. He ended up in the ER, struggling to breathe. We didn\u2019t tell YC or our angel investors. Not because we were hiding, but because we wanted to prove we could handle the pressure. We shipped features from hospital beds. Reviewed code between doctor visits. Sometimes launching means praying your cofounder lives long enough to hit deploy. We launched on time. Twice. He\u2019s okay now and I\u2019m okay now. And the product we built, Willow (YC X25) , didn\u2019t just save time. It helped save us, by making my co-founder work even when he couldn't type. Try it now: WillowVoice.com",

They follow the same pattern of pulling data from legacy systems (climate computers, greenhouse tracking systems, cameras) into the cloud, transforming it there and processing it further for (real-time) analytics or AI applications.\n\nWhat excites me most about this work is the bare-metal reality of our clients\u2019 tech stacks which in turn poses an engineering challenge for us to build pipelines that are both solid and cost-effective.

When the stakes are body-cam footage, evidence integrity, and prosecution in court, speed for speed\u2019s sake is reckless. That\u2019s why Code Four (YC X25) ships secure and reliable before it ships fast. We're proud to do things that don't scale. We hop on planes, sit with every user, and won\u2019t leave until their first report flows end-to-end without a hiccup. To honor that commitment \u2014 and the people who inspire it \u2014 Dylan Nguyen , Natnael K. , and I are spending Memorial Day hand-delivering donut boxes to 30+ departments around the bay to thank them for their service. We're still en route. Want us to swing by your precinct? DM me and we\u2019ll pull up.",
